This happened after Jimmy personally attended one of Pete’s live shows in NYC and immediately&nbsp;invited him on the show. Pete’s joyful humor comes from his Midwestern roots. Raised in Janesville, WI by divorced parents and a 19-inch&nbsp;television, he was destined to pursue&nbsp;a career in entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, Pete flew to New York to make his television debut on&nbsp;Comedy Central’s&nbsp;<i>Premium Blend</i>, and the taping went so well that he decided to move to NYC. Soon after moving to NYC, he was selected to perform at the&nbsp;Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, where he was voted a standout performer. In 2008 Pete made his network television debut performing on&nbsp;NBC’s&nbsp;<i>Last Comic Standing</i>&nbsp;finishing as a semi-finalist. That same year, he made his television acting debut on the&nbsp;CBS Soap Opera&nbsp;<i>As&nbsp;The World Turns</i>. At the end of 2008, he shot his own&nbsp;Comedy Central&nbsp;<i>Half Hour Special</i>,&nbsp;which earned him a cult&nbsp;following at comedy clubs, and the opportunity to perform over the next ten years at 500 colleges across the country.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010 Pete began producing and editing his own shows for the Internet which led to getting his own web show on&nbsp;MSN.com&nbsp;called&nbsp;<i>New York Minute:30</i>. His web shows attracted the attention of television talent scouts and in 2012 he was hired to be a writer and cast member on&nbsp;FUSE TV’s&nbsp;<i>Video on Trial</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;NFL Network’s&nbsp;<i>Top 10’s</i>.&nbsp;In 2013,&nbsp;Pete was hired as a cast member on&nbsp;VH1’s&nbsp;<i>Best Week Ever</i>,&nbsp;where he was a writer and cast member for three seasons.&nbsp;That same year, he made his late night television debut on&nbsp;CBS’s&nbsp;<i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Pete&nbsp;is a cast member of&nbsp;TruTV’s&nbsp;<i>Greatest&nbsp;Ever</i>&nbsp;and he&nbsp;hosts his own segment on&nbsp;Nickelodeon’s&nbsp;<i>Nick&nbsp;Toons</i>,&nbsp;in co-ordination with the&nbsp;NFL,&nbsp;called&nbsp;<i>NFL Rush</i>. He’s also a regular on&nbsp;TruTV’s&nbsp;<i>Comedy Knockout</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Comedy Central’s&nbsp;<i>Roast Battle</i>. And he starred in a documentary titled&nbsp;<i>I Need You to Kill</i>&nbsp;that is now available on&nbsp;<i>iTunes and Amazon</i>.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t heard of Pete Lee yet, prepare to tell other people.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Comedian</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Frank Caliendo","partyId":"BB0CAC59-3377-40E1-A924-4578A77EBE6B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian</p>\n","friendlyId":"frank-caliendo"},{"name":"Colin Jost","partyId":"C56EE347-EEE7-4124-B43B-36225D5E647B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">Head Writer,&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night Live &amp;</em> Co-Anchor,&nbsp;\"Weekend Update\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"colin-jost"},{"name":"Trevor Noah","partyId":"7A5C0F29-E605-4B78-931F-E3AEC0A1BDDF","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning Comedian Known for Hosting&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show</em>​​​​</p>","friendlyId":"trevor-noah"},{"name":"Gabriel Iglesias","partyId":"6A4B5EC0-4095-4FDB-A034-893B15618804","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian</p>\n","friendlyId":"gabriel-iglesias"},{"name":"James Corden","partyId":"2485EC74-940D-4DFE-A799-3A6A784CD918","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, <em>The Late Late Show with James Corden</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"james-corden"},{"name":"Adam Conover","partyId":"02BAF0D1-1E8F-4E88-A1F3-B749285D6E21","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, truTV's <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"adam-conover"}],"topics":["Humor"],"types":["College & University","Comedians","Moderator Hosts & Emcees"]}}},
