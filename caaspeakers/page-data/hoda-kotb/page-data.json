She was so engaging and enthusiastic about being here. Her speech was incredible and the lines of women who were trying to get a photo with her and buy her book were out the door. Everyone loved her, and now we don’t know how we are going to top her next year.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Bryant University Women's Summit"}},{"text":"<p>What a fabulous day we had with Hoda! Oh my...she is fantastic...She is the most friendly and accessible celebrity ever, seriously. Fantastic one on one and in front of a crowd! She made 320 new best friends. We are blessed that she would come...Thank you for making the magic happen.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"The Lubbock Women’s Club"}},{"text":"<p>I can honestly not put into words just how unbelievable Hoda was for our event! She not only delivered on the speaking engagement, but she set the tone for the entire day! The second she walked into the Country Club there was an overwhelming sense of joy and party for the rest of the day! She took selfies with everyone there and created such a warm feeling throughout the room. It was WAY more party and WAY less stuffy luncheon! No dollar amount could have been put on what she did for us and for Interfaith! To say she knocked it out of the park is a huge understatement. We are still on cloud 9 from Friday!! Thank you SO MUCH for all that you did to make it happen! Home run all the way around! Thank you!</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Interfaith Housing Coalition   "}}],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Anderson Cooper","partyId":"33497CE3-8308-463D-A508-AB87B581F911","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, <em>Anderson Cooper 360°</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"anderson-cooper"},{"name":"Christina Applegate","partyId":"CCF67B48-4BDC-4A18-A019-50DF9C557F65","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress</p>\n","friendlyId":"christina-applegate"},{"name":"Van Jones","partyId":"4FEC28CC-7385-424B-B527-89DE67A0EB2E","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning Producer, Social Entrepreneur, &amp;&nbsp;CNN Host</p>","friendlyId":"van-jones"},{"name":"Amy Robach","partyId":"C4035C96-FE84-4D40-91B5-97B857D6D97B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">Co-Anchor, ABC News&rsquo; GMA3: What You Need To Know &amp; Bestselling Author of&nbsp;<i>Better</i></p>","friendlyId":"amy-robach"},{"name":"Gayle King","partyId":"29412D6E-9E30-4A36-8E4A-5AAD3F088B57","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Host,&nbsp;<em>CBS This Morning</em>&nbsp;and Editor-at-Large,&nbsp;<em>Oprah Daily</em></p>","friendlyId":"gayle-king"}],"topics":["Cancer","Diversity⸒ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Health & Wellness","News & Media","Women's Health"],"types":["Celebrity Authors","Celebrity Speakers","Inspiring Women"]}}},
