Women live on average six years longer than men, but save just two-thirds as much for retirement. The causes are widespread, from earning less than men at every stage of their careers to outsourcing financial management to the men in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>This talk can be tailored to women’s groups looking for how to engage on this, or to financial services firms who see this as a business opportunity:</p>\n\n<p>For women’s groups – Krawcheck brings practical advice and tips, learned both from her business background, as well as from her own personal experience, for women at every stage of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>For businesses – The business opportunity that this presents is significant, but it’s not as easy as putting a pink bow on the checking account. Many firms have failed in the pursuit of women. Krawcheck offers insights into this important and growing market, which derive from her business as well as her personal experiences.</p>\n","title":"Women and Money: Insights from the \"Most Powerful Woman on Wall Street\""},{"text":"<p>The wealth management business is the subject of much commentary by industry pundits…a good portion of it wrong. The business is in many ways stronger than conventional wisdom would have it—but faces some significant obstacles and headwinds that if not addressed will have a meaningful impact on the business (as well as its cousins, the asset management and research businesses). Having run two of the largest wealth management businesses in the world, Sallie Krawcheck offers insider insights, many counterintuitive, into the business that financial services professionals will find useful as they participate in, partner with or serve that business.</p>\n","title":"The Outsider Inside: The “Last Honest Analyst” on the Future of Wealth Management"},{"text":"<p>As a top-ranked research analyst, a chief financial officer and senior manager in financial services over the past 20 years, Sallie Krawcheck has an unmatched perspective on the financial services industry. It is an industry whose future is uncertain, given stepped-up regulation, populist anger, an unfavorable operating environment and the increasing importance of technology. Unraveling the secular from the merely cyclical is challenging but crucial, both for the industry, as well as for the broader economy. Krawcheck does so with an insider’s knowledge and an analyst’s perspective.</p>\n","title":"The Outsider Inside: The “Last Honest Analyst” on the Future of Financial Services"},{"text":"<p>Krawcheck has been on the front lines of financial services for the past two-plus decades. During that time, she has led and managed complex businesses through some of the most volatile markets in history. At the same time, she has had a front-row seat in working directly for seven financial services CEOs, at all points in their career spectra, gleaning important insights into leadership during crisis on what works and what fails. Offering sharp insight, laced with humor, Krawcheck lays out the most important lessons in leadership, and particularly in leadership under fire.</p>\n","title":"Lessons for Women in Business—from the Most Senior Woman in the Most Male of Businesses"},{"text":"<p>Sallie Krawcheck has been on the front lines of financial services for the past two-plus decades.
