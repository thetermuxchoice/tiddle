The paradox of creativity is that structure creates freedom. Even the wildest minds require extreme orderliness and attention to detail so that they have the space and discipline to create.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nConsider:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n– Beethoven sat down everyday at daybreak, regardless of season, and composed until 3:00pm.<br />\n<br />\n– Kafka started writing at 11:30pm each night.<br />\n<br />\n– Mozart taught lessons by day and composed only in the evenings.<br />\n<br />\n– Picasso ate lunch each day with his family in silence and only allowed visitors one day per week.<br />\n<br />\n– Mark Twain awoke at 5:30 am, ate a hearty breakfast, and wrote until 5:00 pm.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis program will allow your organization to:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n1.

The end results include:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n– innovative solutions to further your organization<br />\n<br />\n– attracting and engaging quality employees<br />\n<br />\n– new efficiencies and the end of detrimental redundancies<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nGrowth and comfort cannot co-exist.

An engaged employee equals an engaged customer.</p>\n","title":"The Art of Leadership"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Erik Wahl is an internationally recognized artist, TED speaker and best-selling author</li>\n\t<li>Erik inspires organizations to be increasingly agile and outlines how to use disruption as a competitive advantage</li>\n\t<li>He is the author of “The Spark and the Grind: Ignite the Power of Disciplined Creativity” and the best-selling “Unthink: Rediscover Your Creative Genius,” which was hailed by Forbes as \"the blueprint to actionable creativity”</li>\n\t<li>Inspired by street art, he became an acclaimed graffiti artist—though he has since stopped selling his works for personal gain, and instead uses his art to raise money for charities.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Erik Wahl is an internationally recognized artist, TED speaker, and No. 1 best-selling author.
