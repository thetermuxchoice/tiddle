With six National Championship wins, he currently shares the record for most College Football Championships with former Alabama coach Bear Bryant. Along with his 2003 BCS National Championship coaching LSU, Saban was the first coach in college football history to win national championships with two different schools. In addition to his six National Championships, Saban has earned two AP National Coach of the Year awards (’03,’08), the 2003 Bear Bryant Award, and three SEC Coach of the Year awards (’03,’08,’09) among many other accolades. Previously named by&nbsp;<i>Forbes Magazine</i>&nbsp;“The Most Powerful Coach in Sports” and NFL.com’s “Best Head Coach in College Football,” the legend of Saban continues to grow.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Saban’s fiery personality on the sidelines has permeated his team by building clear leadership as the essential foundation for his winning squad for the long term. Not focusing on future results in the horizon, Saban’s coaching staff, players, experts, and fans alike have come to identify Saban’s coaching style as “The Process.” A rigorous work ethic and focus on the immediate moment, Saban instills in his team to concentrate only on the current task at hand. Accomplish the current mission, only then move on to the next, repeat, and eventually the final result will yield success. It’s a philosophy that’s distinguished Saban since his first National Championship with LSU in ’03 and it’s the same credo that’s rewarded his team with their most recent success.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Outside of his coaching duties, Saban and his wife, Terry, founded Nick’s Kids, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping mentally challenged children. Finding an equal passion in this cause as his day job, the Sabans host and organize several functions throughout the year to bring awareness and aid to the fund’s mission. To date, the foundation has distributed over $4 million dollars to deserving recipients and continues to flourish.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Saban and his wife have two children, Nicholas and Kristen. A devout Roman Catholic, Saban’s pre-game ritual always includes having a mass prayer prior to every contest. Born in Carolina, West Virginia, Saban graduated from Kent State University where he played defensive back for the Golden Flashes football team.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Head Football Coach, University of Alabama Crimson Tide</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>Everything was great!
