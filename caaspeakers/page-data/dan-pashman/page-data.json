Over the next three years Dan overcame doubts, design setbacks, manufacturing problems, supply chain issues, and the struggle to find the right partners. In 2021, he launched his new pasta shape -- “cascatelli” -- and shared the story of his three year quest in a series on his podcast, <em>The Sporkful</em>. The series and the pasta went viral, getting featured everywhere from The New York Times and NPR, to CBS This Morning and People Magazine, to Sarah Jessica Parker’s Instagram feed. Now cascatelli can be found in grocery stores and restaurants across the country for years to come. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In this fun and energetic talk Dan will walk you through the story of creating his viral pasta sensation, covering how to use storytelling effectively in your own work, and how to foster creativity and innovation within your audience.
