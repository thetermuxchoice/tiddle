She is currently seen as the host of Telemundo's <i>Top Chef Estrellas</i>. She previously was the host of <i>Simply Delicioso</i> on the Cooking Channel while her Spanish-language show, <i>Delicioso</i>, a weekly one-hour cooking show, aired on the top-rated Spanish language network, Univision. The successful show was previously seen on Telefutura prior to making the big move to Univision. <i>Deliciso</i> was the only cooking show to be broadcast&nbsp;weekly on national television regardless of language.</p>\n\n<p>Considering Ingrid’s loyal fan base in the English and Spanish-speaking communities, she published her cookbook in both languages, <i>Simply Delicioso: A Collection of Everyday Recipes with a Latin Twist</i> and <i>Delicioso: Una Coleccion de Mis Recetas Favoritas con Sabor Latino.</i> For her contribution to bringing awareness to the flavors of all of Latin America, Ingrid was named Flavors of Passion Master Chef of the Year (2011). Ingrid’s most recent book is <i>Latin D'Lite: Delicious Latin Recipes with a Healthy Twist</i> and <i>Deliciosas Recetas Latinas con un Toque Saludable</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Ever the businesswoman, Ingrid has expanded her brand beyond television and partnered with Univision and top cookware and tableware manufacturer, Gibson, to develop a Latin-influenced line, Delicioso. Launched in 2013, the line features a complete collection of cookware, table top, modern kitchen tools and accessories that are designed with the exquisite elements of color and celebrated patterns that are signature of Ingrid’s dynamic personality and Latin culture.</p>\n\n<p>Ingrid's fascination with food, cooking and style began as a little girl. She started cooking with her mother, a Cordon Bleu chef, at such a young age that she needed a stool to reach the stove. She discovered not only a love of cooking, but a flair for entertaining, and in no time developed her own distinctive style.</p>\n\n<p>Raised in Colombia and the Netherlands, Ingrid moved to Miami where she opened La Capricieuse, a high fashion luxury boutique in Coconut Grove. Ingrid also opened Rocca, the first restaurant to feature tabletop cooking on heated lava rocks. Appearing regularly on local TV, Ingrid was noticed by Hearst Entertainment who signed her for her first cooking show, <i>Delicioso with Ingrid Hoffmann,</i> which initially launched in Latin America. In 2006, the show moved to the Spanish language network, Galavision. Ingrid’s English show, <i>Simply Delicioso</i>, premiered on the Food Network in 2007 and moved to the Cooking Channel in summer 2010. She writes a monthly column in <i>People en Espanol</i> and appears weekly on the #1 Spanish language morning show <i>Despierta America</i>. Ingrid has also made appearances on <i>Ellen, Oprah, Martha Stewart, Regis &amp; Kelly, The Today Show, The Early Show</i> and <i>Good Morning America.</i></p>\n\n<p>Ingrid’s success has afforded her the opportunity to give back to the community. She is currently a board member of New York City’s Food and Education Fund and Miami’s Amigos for Kids, as well as an active supporter of Manhattan’s Food and Finance High School, Believe for Colombia Foundation and the Humane Society of Greater Miami.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Chef &amp; Host, Telemundo's \"Top Chef Estrellas\"</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>For the record, she was FABULOUS!
