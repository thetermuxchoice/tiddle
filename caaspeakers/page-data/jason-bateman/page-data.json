Since then, the actor, producer and director has attained leading-man status on the big screen and returned to his roots in television continuing to produce, write and develop projects for the small screen.</p>\n\n<p>Since <i>Arrested Development</i> ended in 2006, Bateman has secured one major film role after another. In 2007, Bateman starred in the action thriller <i>The Kingdom</i> and, prior to this, in <i>Mr. Magorium&rsquo;s Wonder Emporium</i>. In 2008, Bateman starred in Hancock, one of the top box-office openings worldwide. This came on the heels of one of the biggest success stories in independent filmmaking, Jason Reitman&rsquo;s <i>Juno</i>, in which Bateman played a pivotal role as a potential adoptive father.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, Bateman starred with Jennifer Aniston in the romantic comedy <i>The Switch</i>. He shined opposite George Clooney in the Academy Award-nominated <i>Up in the Air</i>, and starred alongside Vince Vaughn and Kristen Bell in Jon Favreau&rsquo;s <i>Couples Retreat</i>. In 2009, Bateman headlined director Mike Judge&rsquo;s <i>Extract</i>, which was produced by Bateman through his F+A Productions banner.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, he starred in back-to-back leading roles, in <i>The Change-Up</i> and the box-office hit <i>Horrible Bosses</i>, in which Bateman reteamed with director Seth Gordon.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2013, Bateman co-starred with Melissa McCarthy in <i>Identity Thief</i>. Shortly after in April 2013, Bateman starred in the thriller drama <i>Disconnect</i>. Bateman&rsquo;s feature film directorial debut, <i>Bad Words</i>, premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. He was most recently seen in <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>, starring alongside Tina Fey, Rose Byrne and Timothy Olyphant. He also reprised his role in the 2014 sequel <i>Horrible Bosses 2</i>. His other film credits include the comedy <i>The Ex, The Break-Up, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,</i> and <i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i>.</p>\n\n<p>On the small screen, Bateman secured a first-look production deal for his company F+A Productions to develop, direct, and write original content for FOX Television. The deal came to fruition after Bateman directed the network&rsquo;s comedy pilot <i>Do Not Disturb</i>, in Fall 2008. He also re-teamed with <i>Arrested Development</i> creator Mitchell Hurwitz to voice a character in the FOX animated comedy series <i>Sit Down, Shut Up</i> in April 2009. Bateman recently reprised his role as &lsquo;Michael Bluth&rsquo; in the 14-episode return of <i>Arrested Development</i>, which was released by Netflix May 2013. Bateman&rsquo;s return earned him a 2013 Emmy nomination for a Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.</p>\n\n<p>As a teenager, Bateman starred in the television series <i>Silver Spoons, It&rsquo;s Your Move, Valerie,</i> retitled <i>Valerie&rsquo;s Family</i> and then <i>The Hogan Family</i> and <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2010, Bateman and Will Arnett, his longtime friend and <i>Arrested Development</i> co-star, created the digital-driven production company DumbDumb Productions, to produce commercials, shorts and original content for distribution on the Internet and for the film industry. Following this, Bateman established the production banner Aggregate Films with a first-look, two-year partnership with Universal Pictures and Universal Television.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Award-Winning Actor, <em>Ozark </em>and<em> Arrested Development</em></p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Alec Baldwin","partyId":"6FBBEB70-875C-4612-99D4-5923837253CA","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actor, Author, and Philanthropist</p>","friendlyId":"alec-baldwin"},{"name":"Julia Louis-Dreyfus","partyId":"435AB84B-810A-47D9-8A6B-381751C33AA5","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress</p>\n","friendlyId":"julia-louis-dreyfus"},{"name":"Geena Davis","partyId":"79AF8C9A-C95E-413D-9E3B-C3316D1AFBE0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Academy Award-Winning Actor; Founder &amp; Chair, Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media</p>","friendlyId":"geena-davis"},{"name":"Mitchell Hurwitz","partyId":"70F09C56-C51A-464C-863C-4B64B8FF56D7","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Creator &amp; Executive Producer, \"Arrested Development\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"mitchell-hurwitz"},{"name":"Eric Stonestreet","partyId":"0A5C2170-5233-4437-829C-44D58D6EF2AA","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Star, ABC's <em>Modern Family</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"eric-stonestreet"}],"topics":["Pop Culture"],"types":["Celebrity Speakers","Actors"]}}},
