Blair&rsquo;s longstanding career began with her comedic roles in pop culture classics<em> </em>in the early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p>Blair is perhaps best well known for her scene-stealing performance as &lsquo;Vivian Kesington&rsquo; in MGM&rsquo;s hit romantic comedy <em>Legally Blonde, </em>alongside Reese Witherspoon. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Motion Picture &ndash; Musical or Comedy. Blair played the role of Cecile Caldwell in <em>Cruel Intentions&nbsp;</em>alongside Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe. Columbia Pictures released the film, which was directed by Roger Kumble. Blair has worked with an array of acclaimed directors including Guillermo del Toro and Todd Solodnz, to name a few. Additionally, Blair was named one of<em>&nbsp;Time Magazine&rsquo;s People of The Year</em>&nbsp;as one of their Silence Breakers.</p>\n\n<p>Blair released her first memoir titled <em>Mean Baby </em>in which she tells the captivating story about growing up and finding her truth. Over the course of the beautiful and, at times, devasting memoir, she lays bare her addiction to alcohol, her devotion to her brilliant and complicated mother, and the moments she flirted with death. There is brutal violence, passionate love, true friendship, the gift of motherhood, and, finally, the surprising salvation of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>Blair can be seen as the subject of the documentary,&nbsp;<em>Introducing, Selma Blair,&nbsp;</em>which premiered to rave reviews at&nbsp;SXSW, where the feature won the Special Jury Recognition for Exceptional Intimacy in Storytelling. The film also won the New York Women in Film &amp; Television Documentary Award at the Hamptons Film Festival and received three Critics Choice Documentary Award nominations, including Best Documentary Feature.&nbsp;The documentary reveals Blair&rsquo;s intimate and raw journey with Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Blair starred in the comedy/horror thriller <em>Mom and Dad</em>, alongside Nicholas Cage. The film follows a teenage girl and her younger brother as they must survive a wild 24 hours during which a mass hysteria of unknown origin causes parents to turn violently on their own kids. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was later screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Molins Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Jury Prize for Best Film and the Audience Award for Best Films. Variety critic Dennis Harvey wrote &ldquo;<em>She [Blair] covers a gamut from bittersweet sympathy to farce to monstrousness, running amok like a cat on piano keys, yet hitting each note perfectly. &ldquo;Mom &amp; Dad&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the kind of movie they give acting awards to &mdash; but in a just world, it would be.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>On television, Blair was recently seen co-starring as &ldquo;Kris Jenner&rdquo; in FX&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;The People vs. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story&nbsp;</em>for Ryan Murphy.</p>\n\n<p>Blair also starred in Todd Solodnz&rsquo;s <em>Dark Horse</em> as Miranda (formerly &lsquo;Vi&rsquo;), alongside Christopher Walken and Mia Farrow. The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival and was later released by Virgil Films &amp; Entertainment.

Blair also starred in Robert Benton&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;Feast of Love</em><em>, and </em>John Water&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;A Dirty Shame</em>. Blair reconnected with her<em>&nbsp;Cruel Intentions&nbsp;</em>director Roger Kumble in<em>&nbsp;The Sweetest Thing </em>for Columbia Pictures,<em> </em>alongside&nbsp;Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Jason Bateman.</p>\n\n<p>Blair also starred on television as &lsquo;Kim&rsquo; on<em>&nbsp;Kath &amp; Kim&nbsp;</em>for NBC opposite Molly Shannon.
