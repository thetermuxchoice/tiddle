He sells out clubs across the nation, is a weekly guest on <i>The Adam Carolla Show</i> podcast and recently started his own podcast, <i>The Koy Pond with Jo Koy</i>. His infectious, explosive energy onstage, insightful jokes, and family‐inspired humor cross all boundaries. Jo, who was raised in Tacoma, WA, credits his mother for his comedic and acting talents. She encouraged him to participate in school talent shows and to hold impromptu performances for his family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>This loving support led to performances at a Las Vegas coffee house, and inspired a move to Los Angeles. In 2005, Jo had the “opportunity of a lifetime,\" when he performed on <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>. He became one of a select few comics to receive a standing ovation on the show.</p>\n\n<p>Jo Koy pulls inspiration from his family and specifically his son. He has had two Comedy Central specials “Don’t Make Him Angry” and “Lights Out.” Jo has appeared on over 100 episodes of <i>Chelsea Lately</i> and has been seen on VH1, <i>World's Funniest Fails, The Joy Behar Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Call with Carson Daly</i> and <i>Jamie Foxx: Laffapalooza.</i></p>\n\n<p>Jo is a firm believer in service and giving back to the community and is currently working with The Lupus Foundation to bring awareness to this cause. Jo currently resides in Los Angeles, California.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Host, <em>The Koy Pond with Jo Koy</em></p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Bobby Lee","partyId":"D19DF9FE-3A1C-4A3E-AAC6-6CEF85EC69E8","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian</p>\n","friendlyId":"bobby-lee"},{"name":"Colin Jost","partyId":"C56EE347-EEE7-4124-B43B-36225D5E647B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">Head Writer,&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night Live &amp;</em> Co-Anchor,&nbsp;\"Weekend Update\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"colin-jost"},{"name":"Michelle Collins","partyId":"DCEBB099-1FEF-4E6B-911A-E5288C9D6A43","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian and Talk Show Host</p>\n","friendlyId":"michelle-collins"},{"name":"Adam Conover","partyId":"02BAF0D1-1E8F-4E88-A1F3-B749285D6E21","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, truTV's <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"adam-conover"}],"topics":[],"types":["Actors","Comedians"]}}},
