Values-based storytelling and marketing have been the go-to approach for the last decade, but as brands have rushed to paint themselves as the most genuine and honest, younger consumers have pushed back.</p>\n\n<p>As the Head of Research and Consumer Insight at BDG Media, Dr. Jessica&nbsp;Tarlov&nbsp;provides&nbsp;audiences with a guide to connecting with GenZs and Millennials rooted in custom research that swims against the traditional digital media current. Her focus on the importance of human connection over digital connectivity for GenZ and Millennials as well as their newfound reliance on instincts over institutions equips audiences with a fresh perspective to inform their consumer marketing strategies. These strategies go beyond the usual talk about &ldquo;finding your company mission&rdquo; and &ldquo;authentically connecting&rdquo; with your audiences. In this new landscape, brands are up against a much more discerning &ndash; and skeptical &ndash; consumer. And Jessica will show them how to crack the code.</p>\n\n<p>Audience takeaways include:</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep understanding of the current GenZ and Millennial cultural zeitgeist</p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to take independent action that will inspire consumer loyalty</p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to utilize the strength of &ldquo;everyday people&rdquo; in meaningful marketing</p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to respond to brand safety crises</p>\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look at brands that are doing it right&nbsp;</p>","title":"Telling Stories That Stick: Connecting with GenZs and Millennials in an oversaturated marketplace"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Jessica Tarlov is the Vice President of Research and Consumer Insight for Bustle Digital Group.</li>\n\t<li>Tarlov leads a team that combines business strategy, custom research, and consumer insights to help their partners better connect with their audiences - with an emphasis on reaching Gen Z and Millenila audiences.</li>\n\t<li>Tarlov also joined FOX News Channel as a contributor in 2017 and serves as one of the liberal co-hosts of&nbsp;<em>The Five</em>, the most-watched show in cable news.</li>\n\t<li>She advises organizations on how and when to get involved with politics, how to put their values front and center, and how to communicate with opposing voices.</li>\n</ul>","title":""}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Jessica Tarlov is the Vice President of Research and Consumer Insight for Bustle Digital Group.
