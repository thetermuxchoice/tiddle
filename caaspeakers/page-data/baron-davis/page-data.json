He decided to use his platform and the knowledge he gained to support others by investing and funding entrepreneurs and start-ups that he believes in, including those created to impact society and encourage change. Davis has also become an outspoken advocate for financial literacy, ed-tech, and VC leaders from underrepresented communities. He&nbsp;is also currently launching the \"More Than Us Venture Studio\" to empower underrepresented communities to develop and create non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>\n\n<p>Davis continues to see opportunities and gaps in several industries, and where he can’t find companies that fill those gaps, he creates them.
