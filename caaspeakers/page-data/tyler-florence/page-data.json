This was his third appearance at our show. He’s very polished on stage. He also had one of my favorite timely lines of the weekend. During Michael Symon’s ‘Block Party’ on Saturday, we were surrounded by 10 local food trucks indoors at this signature event. Tyler steps on stage and says, “Wow, look at all these Food Trucks (pause) Let’s race them!” Well played.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Fabulous Food Show, Cleveland"}},{"text":"<p>Every single guest is in need of being rolled home tonight.
