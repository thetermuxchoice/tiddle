The pursuit led to other spectacles featuring cramped spaces and extreme conditions: \"Frozen in Time,\" which saw him encased in a block of ice for almost three days, and \"Vertigo,\" where he stood atop a 100-foot pillar for 35 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Blaine's stunts continue to draw immense crowds and Nielsen ratings to match, but his appearance on <i>Oprah</i> was perhaps most stunning, when he broke the Guinness world record for breath-holding, staying underwater for 17 minutes and 4.5 seconds.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>World Record-Holding Illusionist</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Erik Wahl","partyId":"57FAB552-4C80-4DED-8C45-31B89724AC86","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Graffiti Artist, Author &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"erik-wahl"},{"name":"Spike Lee","partyId":"D532B407-925A-4E1F-BBA5-F1840B390CA5","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Director, Writer, Actor &amp; Producer</p>\n","friendlyId":"spike-lee"},{"name":"Will.i.am","partyId":"7CFE9FF6-91CF-4625-BA91-F8EFBE838619","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Musician</p>\n","friendlyId":"william"},{"name":"Apollo Robbins","partyId":"7EC44DE0-E918-423A-94CE-366F4640162A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>\"The Gentleman Thief\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"apollo-robbins"},{"name":"Shin Lim","partyId":"09AF94B7-B58B-4E84-8AFA-2D06D5C9E479","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Performer and Choreographer of Musical, Magical Routines</p>","friendlyId":"shin-lim"},{"name":"David Kwong","partyId":"43B3EABE-4200-45B5-B8F1-770B62BFA57A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Enigmatist: Magician and New York Times Crossword Writer</p>\n","friendlyId":"david-kwong"}],"topics":["Pop Culture"],"types":["Virtual Experiences","Magicians / Illusionists"]}}},
