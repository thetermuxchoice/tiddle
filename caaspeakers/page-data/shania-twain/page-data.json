But in this extraordinary conversation, Shania will reveal to audiences&nbsp;that she is so much more. Her story begins with her being&nbsp;one of five children born into poverty in rural Canada, where her family often didn&rsquo;t have enough food to send her to school with lunch. She then was&nbsp;the teenage girl who helped her mother and young siblings escape to a battered woman&rsquo;s shelter to put an end to the domestic violence in her family home. And later became&nbsp;the courageous twenty-two-year-old who sacrificed to keep her younger siblings together after her parents were tragically killed in a car accident.<br />\n<br />\nShania Twain&rsquo;s life has evolved from a series of pivotal moments that show her true resilience. Shania spares no details as she takes audiences through the events that have made her who she is. She recounts her difficult childhood, her parents&rsquo; sudden death&nbsp;and its painful aftermath, her dramatic rise to stardom, her devastating betrayal by a trusted friend, and her joyful marriage to the love of her life. From these moments, she offers profound, moving insights into families, personal tragedies, making sense of one&rsquo;s life, and the process of healing. Shania Twain is a singular, remarkable woman who has faced enormous odds and downfalls, and her extraordinary story will provide wisdom, inspiration, and hope for anyone.</p>","title":"From This Moment On: A Story of Resilience"}],"speakerBioSummary":[],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Shania Twain is a phenomenon with more than 41 million albums sold in the U.S. She is&nbsp;one of the top-selling female artists in history with multi-platinum album sales in 32 countries including Canada, Australia, the UK, Indonesia, Holland, and Norway.
