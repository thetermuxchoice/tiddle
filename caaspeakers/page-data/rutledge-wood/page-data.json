After moving from Birmingham, Alabama to Peachtree City, Georgia in 1995 and completing high school, Rutledge went on to graduate from the University of Georgia with a degree in marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Rutledge’s first experience in NASCAR came during his first job in entertainment: traveling with the NASCAR circuit for Country Music Television’s mobile marketing activation. Soon after, Rutledge was hired by SPEED TV, (now FoxSports 1) where he worked for 10 seasons covering NASCAR. He was a correspondent for NASCAR Sprint Cup Series pre-race show, NASCAR RaceDay, and has hosted or co-hosted various NASCAR shows and events for Fox Sports, including SPEED Road Tour Challenge, NASCAR Smarts, and NASCAR Live, as well as the annual NASCAR Awards Banquet.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Host of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Floor is Lava&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;The American Barbecue Showdown</em></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Kevin Negandhi","partyId":"CACD0EEE-096C-429E-8A26-7BA364C26811","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Anchor, ESPN's \"SportsCenter\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"kevin-negandhi"},{"name":"Joe Buck","partyId":"8819408C-27E4-4DD0-8734-CA056E31432F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Fox Sports Commentator</p>\n","friendlyId":"joe-buck"},{"name":"Jimmy Johnson","partyId":"C773AE02-B59C-468A-9C82-20307E9DB3B6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Football Analyst, Fox Sports</p>\n","friendlyId":"jimmy-johnson"},{"name":"Adam Schefter","partyId":"813D3C75-962C-4E2E-93E6-B7B0150141B0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>ESPN NFL Insider</p>\n","friendlyId":"adam-schefter"},{"name":"Jeff Gordon","partyId":"F468A471-2E18-4FA9-AB2C-1990E686C9B1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Legendary NASCAR Driver</p>\n","friendlyId":"jeff-gordon"},{"name":"Daniel Ricciardo","partyId":"7C5E6DEE-2D78-4AF1-843B-E02FA6BF8DCF","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Internationally-Renowned Racing Driver&nbsp;</p>\n","friendlyId":"daniel-ricciardo"}],"topics":["Sports - Broadcasters"],"types":["Chefs","Moderator Hosts & Emcees","Reality TV"]}}},
