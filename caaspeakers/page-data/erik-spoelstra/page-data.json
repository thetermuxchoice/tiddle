Initially Spoelstra began his career with the Miami Heat in 1995 as the Video Coordinator for then Head Coach, Pat Riley. After being mentored by the Hall of Famer and growing within the organization, he was elevated to his current position in 2008 when Pat Riley stepped down as Head Coach to become team President.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to taking over the reigns as the sixth head coach in Miami history, Spoelstra was known around the league for his game preparation and superb attention to detail with a strong reputation as a teacher. Additionally, Spoelstra helped design and integrate a proprietary statistical database and scouting software for the Heat.</p>\n\n<p>As head coaching debuts go, Spoelstra orchestrated an impressive one in 2008. Guiding one of the NBA's youngest rosters, the Heat recorded its greatest single-season improvement in franchise history. He took a 15-win team from the previous season and directed them to a 43-win regular season, which surpassed the franchise record for most wins by a head coach in his first season and a 2009 NBA Playoff berth. Improving the team’s performance every year as Coach, Spoelstra brought the Heat to the NBA Finals four years in a row leading the Heat to back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n\n<p>A team member of the NBA FIT initiative, Spoelstra takes pride in encouraging families to engage in physical activity and healthy living practices. He also created ‘Spo's Shooters’ to give South Florida's less fortunate student-athletes the opportunity to enjoy Heat games and meet their favorite Heat players and role models. Spoelstra participated with the NBA and the U.S. State Department Good Will Sports Envoy Trip to his native Philippines, while hosting basketball clinics and promoting the importance of education, health and wellness to thousands of at-risk youth. In 1992, he graduated from the University of Portland with a degree in communications.</p>\n\n<p>While attending the University of Portland, Spoelstra was the starting point guard for all four years and was named the West Coast Conference Freshman of the Year in 1989 before a brief international playing career. Raised in Portland, Spoelstra is the first Asian/Filipino-American head coach in any of the major North American sports leagues.</p>\n\n<p>\"He's a man that was born to coach\" -Pat Riley</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Head Coach, Miami Heat</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"John Calipari","partyId":"E5A380AB-10B2-4424-9213-60A7CB70A7C1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Head Basketball Coach, University of Kentucky Wildcats</p>\n","friendlyId":"john-calipari"},{"name":"Pat Riley","partyId":"1F487AD3-0CA3-455B-B94A-84CD8CD79658","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Team President, Miami Heat</p>\n","friendlyId":"pat-riley"},{"name":"Dwyane Wade","partyId":"21D4D006-352C-4230-9587-E762C1EC9FCE","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>NBA Champion, Former Miami Heat Guard &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"dwyane-wade"},{"name":"Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson","partyId":"85483E69-9EAA-4A4E-BC42-F6AB3635B9C4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Basketball Legend &amp; Businessman</p>\n","friendlyId":"earvin-magic-johnson"},{"name":"Carmelo Anthony","partyId":"F04AFB17-79D5-4677-827E-C4EEA02CDF76","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Ten-Time NBA All-Star, Two-Time Olympic Gold Medalist &amp; Entrepreneur</p>","friendlyId":"carmelo-anthony"},{"name":"Anthony Lynn","partyId":"118791FA-79AB-4B7E-97C7-59D7C5B7E327","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">NFL Football Coach, San Francisco 49ers</p>\n","friendlyId":"anthony-lynn"}],"topics":["Asian","Diversity⸒ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Leadership","Sports - Basketball","Sports - Coaches","Team Building"],"types":["* Featured Speakers","Coaches","Motivational"]}}},
