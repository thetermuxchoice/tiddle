Through his struggles with suicide and depression in his life, he has learned to channel his experiences to affect social change, sharing his journey candidly with his combined social audience of nearly 3 million to provide visibility for those dealing with mental illness and using his platform to uplift others. &nbsp;Over the course of 7 years, Demetrius has created comedy skits with poignant messages, lead public speaking events across the United States, developed a successful apparel brand, and constructed a Community Meet-Up series to create a safe space without judgement and bring his community together. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Demetrius started posting YouTube videos during his transition from Middle School to High School as an outlet to cope with the life change. With pure intentions of communicating the thoughts in his head to likeminded people, he began to garner a following. His channel audience grew through Demetrius’ viral comedic skits, which he began posting to spread positivity and smiles, but later allowed him to lend his unique voice to major brands like Wendy’s, Kit Kit, Axe, and House of Hoops.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>But Demetrius isn’t a one trick pony. In 2018, he was chosen to give the Commencement Address at Edsel Ford High School for his outstanding impact on today’s youth. The speech, posted to Demetrius’ YouTube channel, went viral, inspiring audiences far beyond those attending the event of the dangers of comparing oneself to others, the importance of giving and receiving support, and the impact of trusting your heart and following your dreams. Since then he has spread his message across the country, speaking at schools including Michigan State University, Virginia Commonwealth University, University of Michigan, University of Washington, University of Connecticut, and Georgetown University. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Demetrius developed a clothing brand called “<em>You Matter, By Demetrius Harmon” </em>&nbsp;spread awareness about mental health advocacy and positivity. Thus far, the brand includes hoodies, flags, blankets, and t-shirts. Thus far, he has curated one pop-up shop with the hopes of organizing several events in the future, along with over 10 meetups that have featured clothing giveaways, hugs and meaningful conversation. Building on the reaction of those meet-ups, Demetrius created a free community-meet-up series called ‘The Unity,’ bringing different walks of life together and provide a safe space for unity and judgement free fun.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The root of Demetrius’ purpose is to spread love and normalize the complexities of the human experience. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>YouTube Star, Comedian &amp; Mental Health Advocate&nbsp;</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span>It went great!&nbsp;Demetrius was an amazing person to work with, and we had a great crowd.
