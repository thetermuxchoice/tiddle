For Mat, magic quickly became an obsession.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, Mat has developed a unique performance style that blends college humor with shocking magic. He is recognized for creating interactive presentations for his audiences that allow for spontaneity and improvisation.</p>\n\n<p>As a child, learning magic was always Mat's top priority. Growing up in Rhode Island, Mat's way of learning magic was by watching magicians on TV. He would videotape the shows and then study them for countless hours in great detail. At just 12-years-old, after saving money from local shows, Mat traveled to Las Vegas to study and learn from some of magic's biggest names.</p>\n\n<p>Just a few years later, Mat was invited back to Las Vegas as a teenager, being hired to perform at the Riviera Hotel and Casino as part of the Society of American Magicians National Convention. During his teen years, Mat won several awards from the magic community, by competing in statewide and national magic contests.</p>\n\n<p>As a high school student, Mat's only marketing tool was a business card. Mat was always amazed with the power and effectiveness of \"word-of-mouth\" advertising, but to bring his passion to the next level, he knew there was much more to be learned.</p>\n\n<p>Before approaching magic as a full-time endeavor, Franco was a student of Business (Marketing) at the University of Rhode Island. Mat also minored in Communication Studies. Using his education as a tool, he was able to morph his hobby into a career. Since graduating from college in 2010, Franco has become a campus favorite across the country. In 2013, Franco won the coveted Male Performer of The Year award from <i>Campus Activities Magazine.</i></p>\n\n<p>In early 2014, Mat decided to enter NBC's <i>America's Got Talent</i> competition. Competing against a wide variety of the country's top talent, Mat emerged as the first magician to win the show's top spot. He is currently starring on the NBC series, <i>Mat Franco's Got Magic</i>.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Star, NBC&#39;s <em>Mat Franco&#39;s Got Magic</em></p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Erik Wahl","partyId":"57FAB552-4C80-4DED-8C45-31B89724AC86","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Graffiti Artist, Author &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"erik-wahl"},{"name":"David Blaine","partyId":"D56096B1-1055-422D-BDF3-08DD02F656F6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>World Record-Holding Illusionist</p>\n","friendlyId":"david-blaine"},{"name":"Apollo Robbins","partyId":"7EC44DE0-E918-423A-94CE-366F4640162A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>\"The Gentleman Thief\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"apollo-robbins"},{"name":"Shin Lim","partyId":"09AF94B7-B58B-4E84-8AFA-2D06D5C9E479","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Performer and Choreographer of Musical, Magical Routines</p>","friendlyId":"shin-lim"},{"name":"Piff The Magic Dragon","partyId":"C0A16A4E-23D2-4455-8422-6A14FCB1A8B4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Magician, NBC's \"America's Got Talent\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"piff-magic-dragon"},{"name":"David Kwong","partyId":"43B3EABE-4200-45B5-B8F1-770B62BFA57A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Enigmatist: Magician and New York Times Crossword Writer</p>\n","friendlyId":"david-kwong"}],"topics":["Humor"],"types":["Moderator Hosts & Emcees","College & University","Magicians / Illusionists"]}}},
