One of the President’s longest serving advisers, Dan joined the Obama campaign at the outset, serving first as traveling press secretary and then eventually becoming the campaign’s communications director. He entered the White House as Deputy Communications Director and, by the end of 2009, had risen to Communications Director.</p>\n\n<p>He held that post until his appointment as Senior Advisor in early 2013. During his time at the White House, Dan has helped transition the communications apparatus into the digital age utilizing social media like Twitter, Facebook, Medium and Instagram, as well as scheduling the first presidential interviews with digital media platforms like Buzzfeed and Vox. In 2015, Dan joined CNN as a political commentator.</p>\n\n<p>Pfeiffer is currently the Vice President of Communications and Policy at GoFundMe, a web service which helps users raise money online. “GoFundMe is all about using technology and social connections to empower people to help people. That empowerment is incredibly important. If you need help for some unexpected reason, you can easily and quickly ask for help from your community,” Pfeiffer said.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2017, Dan along with former White House aides Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor, launched the political podcast, <i>Pod Save America</i>. Each episode, they are joined by journalists, politicians, comedians, and activists for a freewheeling conversation about politics, the press and the challenges posed by the Trump presidency.</p>\n\n<p>A native of Wilmington, Delaware, Dan graduated from Georgetown University. He has previously worked for a number of Democratic politicians including Vice President Al Gore and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Co-Host of&nbsp;<em>Pod Save America</em>&nbsp;&amp; Former Senior Advisor, Obama Administration</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>Dan was good, very direct and to the point.
