She also writes&nbsp;Ask Elaine, a new advice column for The Washington Post where she helps people learn to pivot and embrace the changes in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>In partnership with Anonymous Content, Welteroth wrote&nbsp;and is executive producer of&nbsp;the television adaptation of her first book,&nbsp;<em>More Than Enough: Claiming Space for Who You Are No Matter What They Say</em>. The memoir-meets-manifesto became an instant New York Times bestseller and won an&nbsp;NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work.</p>\n\n<p>As the former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, Welteroth broke barriers and became the youngest person to serve as an editor-in-chief at a Cond&eacute; Nast publication and only the second Black journalist to hold the title in the company&rsquo;s history. Prior to that, she was the publishing giant&rsquo;s first-ever Black beauty director and held senior editorial roles at both Glamour and Ebony where she started her career in magazine journalism. During her decade-long tenure, Welteroth used her groundbreaking positions at global mass media companies to prioritize diversity and social justice coverage.</p>\n\n<p>Welteroth released her own MasterClass on designing a dream career by harnessing one&rsquo;s values, skills, and passions.
