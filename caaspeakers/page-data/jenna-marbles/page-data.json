We had a 1,000+ people in attendance which was right at our capacity. Jenna was great with our students and answered questions honestly and offered some wise words in her own special way. We have no complaints!</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"University of Illinois"}},{"text":"<p>The talk went phenomenal, we've had amazing responses from our students who attended the discussion. We were able to touch on a lot of topics that were directly relevant to our institution. Jenna was amazing to work with, super friendly, and if given the chance (and if the cold didn't scare her off) we'd love to have her back one day. All in all, nothing but good things to say!</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"University of Lethbridge "}}],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Tim Chantarangsu","partyId":"2C49D613-855A-4F24-BDDF-858BE674C5DA","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>YouTube Personality</p>\n","friendlyId":"tim-chantarangsu"},{"name":"Bethany Mota","partyId":"2D7083AB-223B-4586-BDE6-3EE03F39EF83","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>YouTube Star</p>\n","friendlyId":"bethany-mota"},{"name":"Anna Kendrick","partyId":"D61CA530-1572-496F-A564-7DA2248EFBBB","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress</p>\n","friendlyId":"anna-kendrick"},{"name":"Jazz Jennings","partyId":"5FB16741-9784-4D82-AD2E-9958F41FA6A2","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Star of TLC's <em>I am Jazz</em>,&nbsp;LGBTQ Rights Activist &amp; Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"jazz-jennings"},{"name":"Anna Akana","partyId":"4DA69BB3-98C5-4068-A64C-51840F1A54C0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>YouTube Star &amp; Actress</p>\n","friendlyId":"anna-akana"},{"name":"Catherine Cohen","partyId":"A080EB37-D69D-4384-B361-5DE09694B694","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian and Actress</p>\n","friendlyId":"catherine-cohen"}],"topics":[],"types":["College & University","Comedians","Digital Influencers","Millennial Speakers"]}}},
