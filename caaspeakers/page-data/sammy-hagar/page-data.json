He enjoyed immediate success with albums such as <i>Nine on a Ten Scale</i> and hits like “Red,” which led to the creation of his persona as “The Red Rocker.”&nbsp;Perhaps best known in his solo career for the wildly popular single “I Can’t Drive 55,” Hagar had his first Billboard #1 record in 1987 with “Give to Live.”</p>\n\n<p>Following his prolific solo run, Hagar joined Van Halen in 1985. As their front man on four consecutive multi-platinum #1 albums - <i>5150</i>, <i>OU812</i>, <i>For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge</i> and <i>Balance - </i>he steered Van Halen to unprecedented popularity before the band broke up in the mid-nineties.&nbsp;In 2004, he returned to Van Halen for the critically acclaimed sold-out reunion tour.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Hager rocks with Chickenfoot, made up of Joe Satriani, Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer, Chad Smith.</p>\n\n<p>Hagar’s business ventures began when he found his first home away from home in Los Cabos, Mexico, where he opened the tourist and local destination staple, Cabo Wabo Cantina. The franchise has since expanded to locations in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Hollywood. It was at the flagship Cantina that he was inspired to create Cabo Wabo Tequila.&nbsp;After overseeing its development from conception to current position as a global brand, he sold Cabo Wabo Tequila in 2007, but maintains an interest in it today. With the recent imagination of Sammy’s Beach Bar Rum, Hagar continues to build on his success in the spirit industry.&nbsp;Conceptualized and produced in his second home away from home, Hawaii, the world class Sammy’s Beach Bar Rum is quickly following the success of Cabo Wabo Tequila.</p>\n\n<p>From very early in his career, Hagar has been a philanthropist – from donating to local food banks in every city he plays to founding charities. In 2009, he embarked upon a joint business and philanthropic venture with Sammy’s Beach Bar and Grill, donating all profits of the two current locations to local children’s charities.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, Hagar released his highly anticipated autobiography, <i>Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock</i>, which reached #1 on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list.</p>\n\n<p>When not continuing to build upon his success in music, business and philanthropy, his #1 priority to be a great father to his children and husband to his wife, Kari.</p>\n\n<p>He currently splits his time between Marin, California and Cabo San Lucas.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Former Lead Singer, Van Halen</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>Amazing show.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Nutanix"}}],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Gene Simmons","partyId":"0F185CCC-5BBE-4FA8-BD1B-7208034C7514","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Media Mogul &amp; Multi Hyphenate</p>\n","friendlyId":"gene-simmons"},{"name":"Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson","partyId":"85483E69-9EAA-4A4E-BC42-F6AB3635B9C4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Basketball Legend &amp; Businessman</p>\n","friendlyId":"earvin-magic-johnson"},{"name":"Dan Aykroyd","partyId":"B10F1C6A-0DDF-49D7-8BA6-4C882547035A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian &amp; Actor</p>\n","friendlyId":"dan-aykroyd"}],"topics":[],"types":["Celebrity Entrepreneurs","Musicians"]}}},
