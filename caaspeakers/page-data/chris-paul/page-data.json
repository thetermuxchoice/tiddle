He is greatly respected by his peers as a leader both in and outside of basketball.</p>\n\n<p>After leaving Wake Forest University (who retired his jersey in March 2013) at the end of his sophomore year, Chris was chosen by the New Orleans Hornets as the fourth pick in the 2005 NBA draft, which led to NBA Rookie of the Year honors, and the first of his twelve All-Star selections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chris joined the Los Angeles Clippers in 2011 becoming the face of the franchise and helped lead the Clippers to their first-ever Pacific Division title in 2013.
