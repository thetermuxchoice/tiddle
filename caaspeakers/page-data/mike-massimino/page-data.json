Through humor and storytelling, he highlights the pursuit and achievement of a childhood dream, the dedication and teamwork necessary to train for one of NASA’s most difficult space missions, the determination needed to face tragedies like the Columbia space shuttle accident, and the innovation and leadership necessary to overcome seemingly insurmountable trials when in space and beyond. He leaves his audiences understanding the value of having passion for what you do, of perseverance in achieving a goal, of building a team to meet great challenges, and of creativity and innovation in problem solving. He also inspires audiences with the awe and beauty of space and shares his thoughts on the future—both personal and in regard to the ever-changing and competitive space program.</p>\n","title":"Views from Space: Leadership, Teamwork, Dedication"},{"text":"<p>Mike and his fellow astronauts spent hours in simulators practicing how they would work and communicate with their support team in the Mission Control Center (MCC) while literally a world apart. He also spent years as a Capcom (Spacecraft Communicator) in MCC communicating with and supporting astronauts in space. Critical problems arose during Mike’s final spacewalk on the Hubble Space Telescope, and even though support team members were at various locations on Earth, they were able to save the day for Mike in space. Although we are now physically separated from each other today due to COVID-19, we can strive to be the person that people can call for help. Reach out and try to be someone else’s Mission Control Center.</p>\n","title":"Working with Your Team and Clients Over Distance"},{"text":"<p>Mike’s NASA training taught him valuable lessons on how to thrive in isolation.&nbsp;Some tips are: try to embrace the situation; concentrate on meaningful work; keep open the lines of communication between friends, family and co-workers; be respectful of the well-being of your crewmates; keep up your self-care and exercise; enjoy the beauty of our planet; and use time away from the hustle and bustle of our normal daily routines to think introspectively about our lives.</p>\n","title":"Dealing with Isolation"},{"text":"<p>Mike’s first spaceflight was on Space Shuttle Columbia. On Columbia’s next voyage, the crew and the space shuttle were lost during re-entry. It was devastating to lose seven of his friends in an instant. While grieving and consoling the families of those fallen heroes, another reality set in: what would happen to the future of the space program? The International Space Station was not yet completed and the Hubble Space Telescope needed repair. Mike and his colleagues would not let the loss of their friends be in vain. Innovative procedures, tools, and techniques were developed to get the shuttle flying again to finish that important work. Mike shares stories of how that same effort and attitude is needed now to recover from the effects of COVID-19 on our businesses and lives.</p>\n","title":"Recovering from Adversity, Tragedy, and Disappointment"},{"text":"<p>Mike’s second space flight was one of the last of the Space Shuttle Program. It was time for NASA to retire the shuttle and move on to the next phase in space exploration. That next phase included flying exclusively on the Russian Soyuz for a few years, and working with commercial companies to provide launch services in the future. Many at NASA did not want to accept these changes. But the last few years have shown that those who accepted these changes have thrived, while those who resisted are no longer contributing.&nbsp;<a>We may not like the new world we are now living in that has forced us to change the way we do business. But by accepting change and knowing that change can provide unseen opportunities, we can still shoot for the stars.</a></p>\n","title":"Being Resilient and Adaptable in Times of Change and Uncertainty"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>A former NASA astronaut and the first person to tweet from space, Mike is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University and the Senior Advisor for Space Programs at the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum</li>\n\t<li>His book,&nbsp;<i><span>Spaceman: An Astronaut’s Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe,</span></i>&nbsp;is a <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</li>\n\t<li>After working as an engineer at IBM, NASA, and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, along with academic appointments at both Rice University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, Mike was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1996</li>\n\t<li>A veteran of two space flights,&nbsp;Mike has received a number of awards including two NASA Space Flight Medals, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, American Astronautical Society’s 2009 Flight Achievement Award, and Star of the Italian Solidarity (Italian Knighthood)</li>\n\t<li>Has made numerous television appearances including a six-time recurring role as himself on the CBS hit comedy <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>,&nbsp;hosting&nbsp;Science Channel's <em>The Planets and Beyond</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Planets</em>,&nbsp;and its special <em>The Great American Eclipse</em></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p><span><span>Mike Massimino, a former NASA astronaut, is a professor of mechanical engineering at Columbia University and the senior advisor for space programs at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum.
