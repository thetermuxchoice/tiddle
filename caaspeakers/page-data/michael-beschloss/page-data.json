Called &ldquo;the nation&#39;s leading Presidential historian&rdquo; by Newsweek, the Charlotte Observer has stated, &ldquo;Michael Beschloss knows more about America&rsquo;s Presidents than perhaps anyone on earth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Bringing to the stage his extensive and riveting knowledge of the Presidency, Beschloss delivers a behind-the-scenes look at American presidents and other towering historical figures. His brilliant analysis illuminates the leadership secrets of the men who sat in the Oval Office &mdash; particularly in times of tumult and change. With talks on leadership, America&rsquo;s division and history of war, Beschloss gives context to the crucial events of our time.</p>\n\n<p>A Wall Street Journal and New York Times bestseller, <em>Presidents of War </em>was called &ldquo;a superb and important book, superbly rendered&rdquo; by the New York Times Book Review. According to the Financial Times, the book &ldquo;looks at leadership from every angle,&rdquo; and praised it as &ldquo;epic&rdquo; and &ldquo;magisterial.&rdquo; Historian Ron Chernow called it &ldquo;monumental and profoundly important,&rdquo; and even actor Tom Hanks said, &ldquo;Once again, Beschloss captures our Presidents in terms both historic and human.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Among his earlier books are two volumes on Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s secret tapes, <em>The Conquerors</em>, about Franklin Roosevelt, Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, and <em>Presidential Courage</em>. He was also co-author (with Caroline Kennedy) of the number-one global bestseller <em>Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations about Life with John F. Kennedy.</em></p>\n\n<p>Beschloss appears regularly on NBC Nightly News, Meet the Press, The Today Show, and other network programs as the NBC News Presidential Historian, and as a contributor to the PBS NewsHour.
