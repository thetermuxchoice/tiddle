He is widely recognized for his controversial versions of recent American history, some of them at deep odds with conventional myth -- films such as 1986's <i>Platoon</i>, the first of his Vietnam trilogy (along with <i>Born on the Fourth of July</i> and <i>Heaven and Earth</i>), or 1991’s <i>JFK</i> and 1994’s <i>Natural Born Killers</i> and <i>Nixon</i>, his 1995 take on the finer points and parables of the Nixon administration, as well as on George W. Bush in <i>W</i> (2008). Stone says his films are \"first and foremost dramas about individuals in personal struggles,\" and considers himself a dramatist rather than a political filmmaker.</p>\n\n<p>In 1966, Oliver signed on to the U.S. Merchant Marine, where he worked as a “wiper” in the engine room below deck on several ships. His travels took him from Asia back to Oregon and then Mexico. In Guadalajara, he began writing a first novel, a 1,400-page manuscript entitled <i>A Child's Night Dream.</i> He later reedited the novel down to a manageable 236 pages, which was released 30 years later by St. Martin’s Press (1997).  In 1967, Stone enlisted in the United States Army and served in the 25th Infantry Division near the Cambodian border, where he was wounded twice, and then later in the 1st Calvary Division in the northernmost part of Vietnam. He was honored with a Bronze Star for heroism and Purple Heart for his service.</p>\n\n<p>Tackling subjects often deemed controversial and too grand in scale, Stone continued to build his successful film career in projects like <i>Wall Street</i>, a tale of greed, corruption and power in the excess era of the 80’s and <i>The Doors</i>, a drug-saturated biopic of the legendary and controversial singer Jim Morrison.</p>\n\n<p>Oliver continues to write, direct and produce movies and documentaries that fit with his sensibilities and challenge the conventional teachings. With recent projects like <i>Savages</i>, an action-packed story of three SoCal friends going up against the Baja cartel to his 10-part Showtime documentary series called <i>The Untold History of the United States,</i> Oliver Stone shows no signs of slowing down his creativity while daring the global audience to see events in a whole new light.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Academy Award-Winning Director</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Spike Lee","partyId":"D532B407-925A-4E1F-BBA5-F1840B390CA5","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Director, Writer, Actor &amp; Producer</p>\n","friendlyId":"spike-lee"},{"name":"Kathryn Bigelow","partyId":"BDBF42EF-91F4-456F-B1AC-C2F90D2AA8C0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Director</p>\n","friendlyId":"kathryn-bigelow"},{"name":"Ron Howard","partyId":"B58CCB69-9751-429C-BC03-0A024F796A18","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Academy Award-Winning Filmmaker</p>\n","friendlyId":"ron-howard"},{"name":"Aaron Sorkin","partyId":"9CB99FE7-5D1D-4996-9A31-54705065CDC6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Academy Award-Winning Writer</p>\n","friendlyId":"aaron-sorkin"},{"name":"Dawn Porter","partyId":"9E30674A-A653-4980-AF62-1D2D437B901D","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Documentary Filmmaker</p>","friendlyId":"dawn-porter"},{"name":"Ava DuVernay","partyId":"C010E083-B04B-40DF-A1BF-0E05D00077E6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Director</p>\n","friendlyId":"ava-duvernay"}],"topics":["Storytelling"],"types":["College & University","Directors","Documentarians"]}}},
