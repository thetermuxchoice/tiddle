Joshua Johnson speaks about his journey of not fitting in, living outside the boundaries and challenging norms, all while excelling within the confines of high expectations.</p>\n","title":"Being Strong in Your Skin"},{"text":"<p>The country, media, politics and our conversations feel more divided than ever. How do we connect across ideologies and lifestyles when our discussions reflect the views of media we “agree” with or relate to? As the host of 1A, Joshua Johnson has created a reputation for fostering an empathetic culture that avoids judgement and bickering: what you might call “leadership by listening”. His listeners and guests are free to speak their minds, knowing that they’ll be heard. As a moderator for your event or a keynote, learn how to create this same environment and approach relationships, business or personal, with empathy. We won’t agree with everything someone says, but we can change the way we connect in our homes, communities and offices.</p>\n","title":"Creating a Culture of Trust"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Anchor for MSNBC</li>\n\t<li>Joshua Johnson formerly hosted&nbsp;<em>1A </em>on NPR in partnership with WAMU<em>,</em>&nbsp;one of the most important daily conversations in America.</li>\n\t<li>Launched at a tumultuous time for news and inspired by the 1st Amendment, Joshua and&nbsp;<em>1A</em>&nbsp;bring&nbsp;new insight and inquiry to the most pressing issues of our time.</li>\n\t<li>Before joining WAMU, Joshua co-created and hosted the provocative nationwide public radio series, <em>Truth Be Told</em>, which explored race in America.</li>\n\t<li>He began his public radio career helping launch a unique regional news partnership between Miami’s NPR station, WLRN, and The Miami Herald.
