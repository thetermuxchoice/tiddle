Reaching more than 100 million devoted fans on a monthly basis through her magazines, television shows, books, and products for the home, sold on Martha.com and at multiple retail and online outlets, Martha is the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; source for the homemaker. She and her talented staff provide trusted, timely, and useful information on all aspects of everyday living: cooking, entertaining, gardening, home renovating, collecting, organizing, crafting, healthy living, holidays, weddings, and pet care, both in print and social media.</p>\n\n<p>Raised in Nutley, New Jersey, in a family of six children, Martha developed her passion for cooking, gardening, and homekeeping at an early age. Her mother taught her the basics of cooking, baking, canning, and sewing; her father introduced her to gardening at the age of three. Martha earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in history and architectural history at Barnard College. Upon graduating, she became a stockbroker on Wall Street, where she gained her early business training. After moving to Westport, Connecticut, in 1972, she developed a catering business that showcased her remarkable talent and originality. Her unique visual presentation of food and the elegant recipes she created for her thriving event and catering business were the basis for her first book, <em>Entertaining, </em>published in 1982. 97 more have been published, including bestsellers such as <em>Martha Stewart&rsquo;s Baking Handbook, Martha Stewart&rsquo;s Cooking School, Martha Stewart Flowers, The Homekeeping Handbook, The Martha Manual: How to Do (Almost) Everything, </em>and<em> Martha Stewart&rsquo;s Organizing.</em></p>\n\n<p>Martha&#39;s business sense and creative vision provided the framework for launching her namesake company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 1996, and the expansive multimedia portfolio that includes award-winning properties such as <em>Martha Stewart Living</em>, <em>Martha Stewart Weddings</em>, marthastewart.com, <em>The Martha Living Show</em>&nbsp;and <em>The Martha Show</em>&nbsp;(which over a span of 19 years earned 18 Emmys), <em>Martha Stewart&rsquo;s Cooking School</em>&nbsp;on PBS, and <em>Martha Bakes</em>&nbsp;on PBS. Martha teamed up with longtime friend and collaborator, Snoop Dogg, for <em>Martha &amp; Snoop&rsquo;s Potluck Dinner Party</em>&nbsp;on VH1. Martha&rsquo;s first foray into primetime, which includes&nbsp;both talk and informative cooking show elements,&nbsp;received an&nbsp;Emmy nomination.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to its media properties, Martha Stewart&rsquo;s branded products can be found in tens of millions of homes and in thousands of retail locations. Martha was a pioneer in bringing beautifully designed, high-quality products to mass market with <em>Martha Stewart Everyday</em> products at Kmart. Today, her brand offers high-quality, functional, and affordable products across various product categories including a home collection created for Macy&rsquo;s; crafts at Amazon; office supplies and organization at Staples; a collaborative line of products with QVC, including apparel, accessories, food, wine, seasonal d&eacute;cor, and garden; a meal-kit delivery service, Martha &amp; Marley Spoon; the online wine shop, Martha Stewart Wine Co.; gift baskets with iGourmet; coffee with Barrie House and many others.</p>\n\n<p>Martha launched Martha.com, a direct-to-consumer online platform that combines Martha&rsquo;s beautifully designed products and carefully curated goods with dynamic and engaging content all in one place. Other current retail partnerships include a brand shop with Wayfair including accent furniture, lighting, home d&eacute;cor, textiles, housewares, and more; The Everyday System&trade;, a line of customizable organizational solutions for the entire home, with California Closets; and a robust Amazon brand shop that features books, coffee, food, pet care, garden, seasonal d&eacute;cor, crafts, outdoor furniture, window coverings, and area rugs. She also recently launched CBD-infused wellness gummies, oils, and soft gels for humans in partnership with Canopy Growth in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The Martha family of branded products is owned by Marquee Brands, a leading global brand operator and marketer owned by investor funds managed by Neuberger Berman. Martha joined the Marquee Brands team in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, Martha unveiled the new Martha Stewart Center for Living at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. The center is an outpatient facility for geriatric medicine, providing clinical care and education for patients, offering training for physicians, and coordinating healthy-aging research and practices. Martha was inspired to create the center by her mother, Martha Kostyra, who remained active and engaged in life to the age of 93. In June 2019, Martha opened a second Martha Stewart Center for Living location at Mount Sinai-Union Square dedicated to her grandchildren, Jude and Truman.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning TV Host; Founder, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>She was fantastic!
