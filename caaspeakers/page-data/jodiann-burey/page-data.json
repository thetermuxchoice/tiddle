Born in Jamaica, raised in New York City, and well-traveled globally, her influences transcend boundaries. She draws from education, global health, entrepreneurship, and other disciplines in her work -- with communities of color at the center.</p>\n\n<p>She has interviewed Stacey Abrams and introduced both US Senator Cory Booker and Vice President Kamala Harris during their 2020 campaigns. Whether she&rsquo;s interrogating authenticity at work or exploring systemic bias as the root of imposter syndrome, her critical lens focuses on how things came to be by examining the systems of oppression that construct the choices we make and how we see the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An alum of Boston College and the University of Michigan, Burey leads conversations with prominent community and business leaders with a goal to not just share ideas, but also leverage the power we already have to address inequities all around us. For her, this is where disruption happens.</p>\n\n<p>Burey&#39;s public health and social justice worlds collided with a spinal tumor diagnosis. Along that recovery journey, she built what she needed: a space to not feel alone. Jodi-Ann created <em>Black Cancer</em>, a narrative podcast about identity, trauma, and health inequities. She also serves as a founding co-chair of the Seattle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Community of Practice.</p>\n\n<p>Burey prides herself on being a cool auntie, a twist-out queen, and a reluctant dog owner. She is currently writing her first book.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Thought Leader &amp; Creator of <em>Black Cancer</em> Podcast</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Deesha Dyer","partyId":"89CD299C-18DE-494F-B1B2-4BD7B1FE4D51","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Strategist &amp; Community Organizer;&nbsp;Former White House Social Secretary</p>\n","friendlyId":"deesha-dyer"},{"name":"Meena Harris","partyId":"410B3C23-5C10-4F5A-8DD9-1915BCD6F6B0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Founder &amp; CEO, Phenomenal; <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author, <em>Ambitious Girl</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"meena-harris"},{"name":"Cleo Wade","partyId":"02AB3D42-813B-4227-9AFF-A7E764146B1F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Poet &amp; Bestselling Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"cleo-wade"},{"name":"Elaine Welteroth","partyId":"786E4D33-CE9D-41C0-89AF-4C7E41E3F670","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Journalist, NYT Bestselling Author, Judge on <em>Project Runway</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"elaine-welteroth"},{"name":"Dr. Leana Wen","partyId":"068BF5D6-3ABA-4917-BE3E-CC43465E05D3","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emergency Physician, CNN Medical Analyst, and Op-Ed Columnist for The Washington Post</p>\n","friendlyId":"dr-leana-wen"},{"name":"Errin Haines","partyId":"5075022F-2A58-4847-9C2E-3739A605A173","speakerNameSubheading":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Editor at Large &amp; Co-Founder, The 19th*</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","friendlyId":"errin-haines"}],"topics":["Corporate Culture","Diversityâ¸’ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Healthcare","Corporate Consulting","Black History & Culture","Social Justice","Cancer","Women's Empowerment"],"types":["College & University","Inspiring Women","Keynote Speakers","Moderator Hosts & Emcees","Podcast Hosts","TED Speakers","Thought Leaders","Writers / Creators"]}}},
