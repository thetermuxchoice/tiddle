Whether laying her soul bare in her 2008 Book <i>Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far</i> or exploring faith and family in a diverse catalog of hits from “El Shaddai” to “Baby Baby,” Grant’s artistry has continually resonated with audiences since she first hit the national spotlight as a fresh-faced teen with a guitar three decades ago.<br />\n<br />\nGrant’s early work in the Christian music field helped define the genre, and her crossover success in the pop market brought her a global audience. Grant has sold more than 30 million albums, won six Grammys, 26 Dove Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her acclaimed 2013 album <i>How Mercy Looks From Here</i> debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Christian chart, becoming her 16th chart-topping Christian album.<br />\n<br />\nUp next, the iconic artist throws her fans an enjoyable curve ball with <i>In Motion: The Remixes.</i> Enlisting the best remix engineers and DJs in the business, Grant delivers an engaging collection that reveals the timeless power of such classic hits as “Baby, Baby,” “Every Heartbeat,” “Stay for Awhile,” and “Love Will Find a Way” alongside more recent fare such as “Better Than a Hallelujah,” which has evolved from poignant ballad to buoyant celebration.<br />\n<br />\nIt is Grant’s ability to dissolve musical boundaries and impact music lovers of all ages and cultural backgrounds that has made her one of the world’s most celebrated talents for more than three decades. She grew up in Nashville, Tennessee and was just an earnest young singer/songwriter with a guitar when she caught the attention of Word Records. Her career exploded and her name became synonymous with the burgeoning contemporary Christian music movement. When A&amp;M Records took her to the pop world in the early 90s, her fan base expanded exponentially. To date, she has earned three multi-platinum albums, six platinum albums and four gold albums along with ten Top 40 pop singles and seventeen Top 40 Adult Contemporary hits as well as a string of No. 1 songs on the Contemporary Christian charts.<br />\n<br />\nGrowing up as the daughter of one of Nashville’s most respected oncologists, Amy has always taken on the cause of cancer — fundraising and awareness – as often as possible. One of the first big ticket fundraisers she ever hosted was for the American Cancer Society at the Grand Ol Opry and she invited Minnie Pearl, James Taylor and Robin Williams as her guests — they all said yes. Most recently, Amy released \"Welcome Yourself,\" and donating all proceeds to breast cancer research.<br />\n<br />\nGrant currently resides in Nashville.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Award-Winning Musician</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>Amy Grant was tremendous!
