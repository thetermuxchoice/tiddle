The show is a unique look at the time, effort and passion that goes into restoration. He could be seen regularly on HGTV&rsquo;s hit series&nbsp;<em>Fixer Upper</em> and the DIY Network shows <em>Wood Work</em> and <em>Against the Grain</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Clint is also the host of the <em>Man Unmade</em> podcast where he listens and learns from the stories and experiences of women with the goal of normalizing the authority and power of women&rsquo;s voices in a man&rsquo;s ear.</p>\n\n<p>After quitting his sales job in 2011 to pursue his dream of building furniture, Clint and his wife Kelly started Harp Design Co., creating quality, eco-friendly furniture from recycled and reclaimed wood for customers across the U.S. and abroad. The Harps work hard each day to grow as a family and a business whose core values are love, beauty, and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>Clint appeared as a supporting role in <em>Fixer Upper</em>, helping his close friends and stars Chip and Joanna Gaines as they remodel homes in Waco, Texas. The show attracted more than 19 million viewers its first season and remained popular into its fifth and final season. As a regular on the show, Clint would take recycled and reclaimed wood, usually scavenged, and create beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces meant to bring families together, which the Gaines would then incorporate into their final remodel and home designs.</p>\n\n<p>Following <em>Fixer Upper</em>, Clint began work on his own projects, DIY Network shows <em>Wood Work </em>and<em> Against the Grain</em>. Along with his wife Kelly and the team at Harp Design Co, Clint uses reclaimed lumber to build new furniture for clients. Crazy requests with tight deadlines are the norm, but Clint and his team are ready to tackle any and every challenge.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Carpenter, HGTV&#39;s <em>Fixer Upper&nbsp;</em>&amp; Magnolia Network&#39;s <em>Restoration Road</em></p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Amy Matthews","partyId":"92799F87-ED8E-4F60-A04A-DE6B536941B1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, HGTV's \"Renovation Raiders\" &amp; DIY's \"Sweat Equity\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"amy-matthews"},{"name":"Pete Nelson","partyId":"CCAA5C32-6EA8-4852-AD8C-7CF440DE5B0A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Star, Animal Planet&#39;s <em>Treehouse Masters</em></p>","friendlyId":"pete-nelson"},{"name":"Hilary Farr","partyId":"1BA11D8C-DC3C-4F83-82BD-7A9944F169F3","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Host, HGTV&#39;s <em>Love It or List It</em></p>","friendlyId":"hilary-farr"},{"name":"Anthony Melchiorri","partyId":"8219A588-CD7E-4DC7-BD8B-092637E58C86","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, Travel Channel's \"Hotel Impossible\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"anthony-melchiorri"},{"name":"Eric & Lindsey Bennett","partyId":"1D4E0FBF-F02A-4253-9CDE-88288950BD3F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Stars, HGTV's \"Desert Flippers\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"eric-lindsey-bennett"}],"topics":["Creativity","Design","Inspirational Stories"],"types":["HGTV & DIY Stars","Lifestyle"]}}},
