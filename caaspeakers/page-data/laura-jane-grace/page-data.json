In 2012, she publicly came out as a transgendered person and announced she would be transitioning to life as a woman. Leaving the name Tom Gabel behind, Laura Jane Grace has become a public ally for the acceptance of transgendered people.</p>\n\n<p>Grace formed Against Me! in 1997 when she was 17. After transforming into a traditional four-piece a few years later with the crucial addition of guitarist James Bowman, they quickly became a driving force in the punk scene--despite facing an abundance of unsolicited danger. Their first major label album, <i>New Wave</i>, debuted on the Billboard 200 and was named <i>Spin’s</i> \"Album of the Year.\"</p>\n\n<p>The band has released seven albums and toured all 50 states and 29 countries. In their 2014 album, <i>Transgender Dysphoria Blues,</i> Grace shared her lifelong struggle with gender dysphoria.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, Grace bought an abandoned post office in Elkton, Florida and converted it into a studio. Along with the recording studio, which she named Total Treble, she launched an accompanying record label, Total Treble Music. The label released its first album in 2012, Cheap Girls’ <i>Giant Orange</i>, which was also Grace’s first credit as a record producer.</p>\n\n<p>Grace saw another career milestone in 2013, as she co-wrote “Soulmates to Strangers” with rock royalty Joan Jett for Jett’s <i>Unvarnished</i> album.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2016, Grace released the memoir <i>Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout.</i> <i>Tranny</i> provides a searing account of her search for identity and her true self. That same year, Against Me! released their seventh studio album, <i>Shape Shift with Me</i> The band is set to tour behind the new record.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Lead Singer, Against Me!</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>The scheduled 60-minute performance ended up going 90 minutes and ended w/ a standing ovation from the fully packed room.

It was more of a \"story teller\" concert with a super long Q &amp; A then she jumped down from the stage and met with everyone who wanted to meet her. I would highly recommend her to other schools.
