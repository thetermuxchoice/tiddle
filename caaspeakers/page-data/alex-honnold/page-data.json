A gifted but hard-working athlete, Honnold is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control his fear while scaling cliffs of dizzying heights without a rope to protect him if he falls. His humble, self-effacing attitude toward such extreme risk has earned him the nickname Alex “No Big Deal” Honnold.</p>\n\n<p>This Sacramento, California-native’s most celebrated achievements include the first and only free-solos of the Moonlight Buttress (5.12d, 1,200 feet) in Zion National Park, Utah, and the Northwest Face (5.12a) of Half Dome (2,200 feet), Yosemite, California. In 2012 he achieved Yosemite’s first “Triple Solo”: climbing, in succession, the National Park’s three largest faces—Mt. Watkins, Half Dome, and El Capitan—alone, and in under 24 hours. In 2017 Alex completed the first and only free-solo of El Capitan’s “Freerider” route (5.13a, 3,000 feet), a historic accomplishment that has been hailed by many as one of the greatest sporting achievements of our time. Whether climbing with a rope or without, Honnold believes climbing is a fantastic vehicle for adventure, an opportunity to seek out those high-test moments with uncertain outcomes which you’re forced to push through to survive.</p>\n\n<p>Though Honnold often downplays his achievements, his rope-less climbs have attracted the attention of broad and stunned audience. He has been profiled by 60 Minutes and the New York Times, featured on the cover of National Geographic, appeared in international television commercials, and starred in numerous adventure films including the Emmy-nominated “Alone on the Wall.” Honnold is sponsored by The North Face, Black Diamond, La Sportiva, and Goal Zero. Honnold is the founder of the Honnold Foundation, an environmental solar energy-focused non-profit, the host of the <em>Climbing Gold </em>podcast, and the author of<em> Alone on the Wall.</em></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>World-Renowned Rock Climber &amp; Star of Academy Award-Winning <em>Free Solo</em></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Rorke Denver","partyId":"41F7F751-0632-400A-9467-3BB2EBC7D182","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Navy SEAL Commander &amp;&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n","friendlyId":"rorke-denver"},{"name":"Diana Nyad","partyId":"7FF49029-D976-4438-BC8F-02B8A13E7578","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>World Champion Athlete, World-Renowned Inspirational Speaker, and Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"diana-nyad"},{"name":"Tommy Caldwell","partyId":"E136BF16-C4B4-4A2A-A990-CDE6BA842C6F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Legendary Rock Climber</p>\n","friendlyId":"tommy-caldwell"},{"name":"Kevin Jorgeson","partyId":"5EC89920-9A90-483A-B0BA-F6DB84FCBE2E","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Legendary Rock Climber &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"kevin-jorgeson"},{"name":"Steven Rinella","partyId":"21BFBD3F-F133-4358-A24E-69206EDAEA1C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">Host of the Top-Rated Podcast &amp; TV Series,&nbsp;<i>MeatEater</i></p>\n","friendlyId":"steven-rinella"}],"topics":["Adventure & Exploration","Climate Change & Sustainability","Fitness","Health & Wellness","Inspirational Stories","Sports - * Headliners","Sports - Other"],"types":["Athletes","Keynote Speakers","Motivational","TED Speakers"]}}},
