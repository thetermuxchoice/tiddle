The PEAK model can be used to understand how a company can relate to relationships beyond those with employees and customers: investors, vendors, the community, and, even with yourself. As a practitioner who has used his own company (with over 3,000 employees) as a laboratory for understanding the human condition, Chip's philosophical but prescriptive approach to leadership will be very illuminating.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","title":"Toward a Psychology of Business: Simple Truths for Creating a Culture of Happiness and Success","sortOrder":4}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Chip Conley is an entrepreneur who formerly served as Strategic Advisor for Hospitality and Leadership at Airbnb.</li>\n\t<li>He is a thought leader at the intersection of psychology and business who&nbsp;disrupts&nbsp;how we think about teaching and learning.</li>\n\t<li>He taught his award-winning methods to hundreds of thousands of Airbnb hosts in nearly 200 countries and&nbsp;also mentored current&nbsp;CEO Brian Chesky.</li>\n\t<li>His book, <em>Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder</em>, ignites a powerful conversation about the value of intergenerational connectivity,&nbsp;the wisdom that comes with age, and how to inspire&nbsp;a growth mindset for people of all ages.</li>\n\t<li>He founded&nbsp;Modern Elder Academy, the first midlife wisdom&nbsp;<em>school</em>&nbsp;dedicated to transforming aging.</li>\n\t<li>He also authored <em>Peak</em> and the New York Times bestseller <em>Emotional Equations</em>, which share his own theories on transformation and meaning in business and life.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","title":""}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Chip Conley&nbsp;served as Airbnb’s Head of Global Hospitality &amp; Strategy for four years.

As the internal mentor to the young Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, Chip got to see the value of intergenerational collaboration in a company that has now grown to be the most valuable hospitality company in the world. His bestselling book <em>Wisdom@Work: The Making of a Modern Elder</em>&nbsp;is a testament to rethinking the value of having 5 generations in the workplace and why more companies are doing their best to encourage their older workers to stay in the workplace longer.&nbsp;While writing <em>Wisdom@Work</em>, Chip was inspired to build the world's first \"midlife wisdom school,\" the Modern Elder Academy, with a 3-acre oceanfront campus in Baja California Sur, Mexico.&nbsp;Chip's Modern Elder Academy has more than 2,000 alums who've come to the Mexican beachfront campus and MEA will be opening two campuses in Santa Fe, New Mexico soon.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Leadership Expert and Former Strategic Advisor, Airbnb</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>I love the Joie de Vivre heart icon that Chip uses to illustrate how a passionate corporate culture breeds happy employees, which leads to satisfied customers, which results in a profitable and sustainable business.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Sir Richard Branson"}},{"text":"<p>Chip is that rare breed of CEO who possesses both a brilliant business mind and a very big heart.
