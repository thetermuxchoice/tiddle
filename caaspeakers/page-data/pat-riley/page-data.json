Few in any profession have achieved the levels of success that Riley has accomplished while serving various roles in nearly half a century of dedication to the game he loves. The list of accomplishments for the 10-time NBA champion is equally long and impressive.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to this executive position Riley’s already storied career includes seven NBA Championships, including five as a head coach. Additionally, Riley was awarded the NBA Coach of the Year honor three times, Head Coach for nine NBA All-Star Teams, 2011 NBA Executive of the Year and most recently adorned with the 2012 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award from the NBA Coaches Association. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest sports and executive minds of all time.</p>\n\n<p>The road to The Heat’s latest championship was one that was engineered meticulously with Riley’s heavy involvement. The knowledge and experience he brought to the Miami organization culminated in the 2010-2011 season with the additions of superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade to form “The Big Three” that sent shockwaves to both the NBA and sports communities. It was an accomplishment that was as impactful as any Riley had made previously to an already legendary career.</p>\n\n<p>As head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Riley led the team to four consecutive NBA Finals winning the Championship in his inaugural year. During his near decade long career as the Lakers’ coach, Riley won a total of four NBA Titles. His fifth and final NBA Championship would come as the head coach of the 2005-2006 Miami Heat. Following his retirement as head coach in 2008, Riley accepted the position of Team President for The Heat where he continues to generate success and champions today.</p>\n\n<p>Complimenting his triumphs as a sports maven, Riley penned two <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers: <em>Showtime</em> and <em>The Winner Within.</em> Both of these books have proven to be the foundation that helped transition Riley into speaking where he was called one of “America’s Greatest Motivational Speakers” as well as being rated “the best in his field” by <em>Success Magazine.</em> Riley’s ability to translate his wealth of experience and wisdom to a results seeking audience is what makes his speaking engagements so extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>He is a consummate competitor who knows the exhilaration that comes with winning. His philosophy is based upon winning, leadership, mastery, change, and personal growth as well as understanding and controlling the shifting dynamics of a team --any team, whether it is a small company, a giant corporation, a city, or a group of athletes. </span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Team President, Miami Heat</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"John Calipari","partyId":"E5A380AB-10B2-4424-9213-60A7CB70A7C1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Head Basketball Coach, University of Kentucky Wildcats</p>\n","friendlyId":"john-calipari"},{"name":"Nick Saban","partyId":"40872094-66D9-4A56-90C9-2D1C54A9500A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Head Football Coach, University of Alabama Crimson Tide</p>\n","friendlyId":"nick-saban"},{"name":"Erik Spoelstra","partyId":"85D4AECD-31EB-4ACC-A676-F1C67086607E","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Head Coach, Miami Heat</p>\n","friendlyId":"erik-spoelstra"},{"name":"Dwyane Wade","partyId":"21D4D006-352C-4230-9587-E762C1EC9FCE","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>NBA Champion, Former Miami Heat Guard &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"dwyane-wade"},{"name":"Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson","partyId":"85483E69-9EAA-4A4E-BC42-F6AB3635B9C4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Basketball Legend &amp; Businessman</p>\n","friendlyId":"earvin-magic-johnson"},{"name":"Brian Cashman","partyId":"D67A7DEB-88AB-4C93-8070-5372CAB87CA5","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>General Manager, New York Yankees</p>\n","friendlyId":"brian-cashman"}],"topics":["Business","Leadership","Sports - * Headliners","Sports - Basketball","Sports - Coaches","Team Building"],"types":["Coaches","Motivational"]}}},
