She has for many years represented women from the Yazidi community -- including 2018 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Nadia Murad -- who are seeking accountability following a campaign of executions and sexual enslavement by ISIS in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;In 2020 she represented a Yazidi woman in the world’s first trial in which an ISIS member was convicted of genocide. She also represents Yazidi victims in the first case alleging complicity in crimes against humanity by a company that funded the terror group. She has represented Armenia in a case involving the Armenian genocide and was recently counsel to 126 victims of the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, at the International Criminal Court. And in 2021 she was appointed Special Adviser to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Darfur.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Clooney also represents political prisoners around the world and has received many honors for her work to secure the freedom of journalists arbitrarily detained across the globe.

She has acted as counsel Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter imprisoned in Azerbaijan for reporting on corruption; Mohamed Fahmy, when he was Al Jazeera’s bureau chief in Cairo; and two Pulitzer Prize-winning Reuters journalists who were imprisoned in Myanmar in 2019 following their reporting on crimes committed against the Rohingya.

One of their <a href=\"https://cfj.org/\">initiatives</a>, TrialWatch, shines a light on injustices by monitoring criminal trials and advocating for the rights of imprisoned journalists, LGBT persons, women, minorities, and human rights defenders. Another flagship initiative, The Docket, gathers evidence of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity to trigger prosecutions and civil suits and advocates for the rights of victims in those trials. The foundation’s most recent initiative – <em>Waging Justice for Women </em>– uses strategic litigation to advance women’s rights in Africa.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Human Rights Lawyer</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Trudie Styler","partyId":"856E1710-A03E-44EA-A813-32F8064331B4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Actress &amp;&nbsp;Activist</p>","friendlyId":"trudie-styler"},{"name":"Kerry Washington","partyId":"0E2CABBF-B66E-47CA-B84F-57287A86FB64","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress &amp; Activist</p>\n","friendlyId":"kerry-washington"},{"name":"Van Jones","partyId":"4FEC28CC-7385-424B-B527-89DE67A0EB2E","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning Producer, Social Entrepreneur, &amp;&nbsp;CNN Host</p>","friendlyId":"van-jones"},{"name":"Freida Pinto","partyId":"A273DF86-BBFB-4E2C-BA7D-113679C48D90","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Actress &amp; Activist</p>\n","friendlyId":"freida-pinto"},{"name":"Kimberley Motley","partyId":"EE79834F-A2F9-4FC2-852B-D1519838D72A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Founder, Motley Legal Services</p>\n","friendlyId":"kimberley-motley"},{"name":"Meena Harris","partyId":"410B3C23-5C10-4F5A-8DD9-1915BCD6F6B0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Founder &amp; CEO, Phenomenal; <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author, <em>Ambitious Girl</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"meena-harris"}],"topics":["Women's Empowerment","Social Justice"],"types":["Celebrity Keynote Speaker","* Featured Speakers","Celebrity Speakers","Inspiring Women","Keynote Speakers","Conference Headliners"]}}},
