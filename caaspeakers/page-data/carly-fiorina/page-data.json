Carly Fiorina has faced and exceeded each and every one these very challenges as she traveled a diverse professional journey, from secretary to CEO, from public to private, and from for-profit to non-profit. Along this often-difficult path of leadership, she grappled with far-reaching, complex strategic decisions with finesse and fortitude.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>In a powerful, pragmatic presentation, Carly shares her transformative career story: from secretary for a </span></span><span><span>nine-person real estate business,</span></span><span><span> to becoming the first woman to lead a FORTUNE 50 company, as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, the world’s first $100 billion information technology company. &nbsp;She delivers reflections and lessons learned from a journey on which she solved the problems in front of her and unlocked the potential of those around her. Based on her own renowned experiences, and with</span></span><span><span> an innate ability to help others reach their highest leadership potential, Carly imparts</span></span><span><span> how leaders can be clear-eyed about their current state, optimistic about their future, and deliberate about getting the results they want.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>In Carly’s words, “leaders are made, not born, and leadership potential exists at every level of every organization.”&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>She knows that everyone has more potential than they realize, that those closest to the problem understand the problem best, and that</span></span><span><span> leadership is not about title, position, or power.

In her six years as Chairman and CEO of HP, she would double its revenues to $90 billion; more than quadruple its growth to 9%; triple the rate of</span> <span>innovation to 11 patents a day; achieve market leadership in every market and product category</span> <span>and quadruple cash-flow</span><span>. This successful transformation was driven by her proven leadership philosophy, commitment to building a diverse team, and execution of proven business tools and practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>From her renowned leadership of HP, Carly shares her personal account of what it takes to create a high-performance culture. She openly discusses navigating a challenging path filled with hurdles like major acquisition, integration, and transformational change. Moreover, for today’s organizations who are forced to adjust in an incessantly volatile business environment, she provides a blueprint for navigating uncertainty, managing change, and building a high-performance culture – all critical keys to empowering and driving results.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"Building a High-Performance Culture: Lessons Learned from a High-Profile Assignment"},{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span>Throughout her career, Carly Fiorina has developed leaders and problem solvers in nearly every sector, from for-profits and non-profits, to faith-based communities and academia. As CEO of Hewlett Packard, chair of two internationally recognized non-profits, and a trusted advisor of executives around the world, she has inspired and empowered diverse groups for decades. She believes that leadership is not about an impressive title or possessing the corner office, but about effectively solving problems and unlocking the potential of those around you.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>Productive members of today’s workforce are increasingly interested in professional growth and development through their surrounding communities, and companies in every industry must provide the tools and resources to meet these very practical needs and foster tomorrow’s leaders. Based on her work leading the Unlocking Potential Foundation, a non-profit organization that invests in human potential by supporting local leaders who are solving problems in their communities and places of work, Carly delivers a powerful presentation that inspires, empowers, and connects employees at every level. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>She shares her proven leadership philosophy, which is based on a set of human behaviors and characteristics that everyone can develop and deploy, as well as a set of practical, accessible tools that enable effective problem-solving.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"Unlocking Potential: Leaders Exist Everywhere"},{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span>Today, more than ever, a successful workplace must be comprised of teams with innovative, diverse perspectives who are empowered to solve their sector’s most challenging problems. <span>Ethnically diverse organizations are 35% more likely to outperform their peers, and companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.</span> But, traditional diversity training is unlikely to foster such a productive environment; instead, effective team building requires an innovative approach based on real-world experience.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>During her long career, Carly Fiorina shattered the glass ceiling by cultivating diverse teams, from top to bottom.

She started out as a secretary for a nine-person real-estate business and eventually became the first woman ever to lead a Fortune 50 company. When Carly was recruited to lead Hewlett Packard (HP) in 1999, the industry was facing the worst technology recession in 25 years. Under Carly’s leadership, revenue grew, innovation tripled, growth quadrupled, and HP became the 11th largest company in the U.S.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>During her tenure at HP, the company received numerous civic recognitions, including being named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by Business Ethics Magazine, one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers by Working Mother Magazine, receiving a 100% rating by The Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, and being named one of the World’s Most Respected Companies by The Financial Times and PricewaterhouseCoopers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>After leaving HP, Carly focused her efforts on giving back. Prior to Unlocking Potential, she served as the Chairman of Good360, the world’s largest product philanthropy organization, and as Chairman of Opportunity International, a Christian-based organization that lifts millions out of poverty around the globe through micro-finance. She also founded the One Woman Initiative in partnership with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to engage and empower women in Pakistan, Egypt, India and the Philippines through increased access to economic opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Carly was appointed by President Bush and CIA Director Michael Hayden to serve as the Chairman of the External Advisory Board of the CIA after 9/11.
