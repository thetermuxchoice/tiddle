He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska. Through each story, Steven grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do. A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Steven paints a loving portrait of a way of life that is part of who we are as humans and as Americans.</p>\n","title":"Meat Eater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter"},{"text":"<p>Through visceral personal stories drawn from thirty years as a modern-day hunter-gatherer, Steven Rinella discusses the logistical, legal and physical challenges of procuring one’s entire intake of meat from the wild. Rinella has hunted and fished for literally hundreds of species of North American wild game, and the tales of his culinary adventures are inspiring, eye-opening, and sometimes shocking.</p>\n","title":"Hunting for Food: An Ancient Path through Modern Life"},{"text":"<p>The American buffalo, or bison, is the perfect example of an interdisciplinary subject that can be made readily applicable to just about every&nbsp;conscientious&nbsp;American's life. A proper understanding of this great beast's history requires tidbits of knowledge on such wide-ranging subjects as anthropology,&nbsp;paleontology, pop music, philanthropy, Nineteenth century politics, paleoecology, the layout of New York City, ballistics, genetics, American cinema, political correctness, and something called horn-core morphology. From its arrival in the New World to its near extirpation and its unlikely salvation, Steven Rinella explains the saga of the American buffalo with a style that critics have likened to a cross between John McPhee and Hunter S. Thompson.</p>\n","title":"American Buffalo: The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of an American Icon"},{"text":"<p>Since Biblical times, humans have debated the necessity and moral implications of the hunting lifestyle. Today, that debate still rages in American culture. But while some argue that hunting is an anachronistic throwback to our barbaric past, others claim that hunting is a form of environmental enlightenment that fosters a strong conservation ethic and a love of the land. Lifelong hunter Steven Rinella is able to frame and inform that debate in an honest, open style, offering insights that will challenge everyone's assumptions -- be they hunter or anti-hunter.</p>\n","title":"The Ethics of Hunting"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Steven Rinella is an outdoorsman, author, and host of the top-rated podcast and TV series, <em>MeatEater.</em></li>\n\t<li>With humor and irreverence, he discusses the hunting lifestyle, wild game, the ethics of hunting, and the spiritual need for wilderness.</li>\n\t<li>Rinella’s award-winning books include <em>The Scavenger's Guide to Haute Cuisine; American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon</em>; <em>Meat Eater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter</em>;&nbsp;and the 2-volume series <em>The Complete Guide to Hunting, Butchering, and Cooking Wild Game</em>.</li>\n\t<li>Rinella's writing has also appeared in a wide variety of popular publications, including Glamour, Men’s Journal, Outside, New Yorker, the New York Times, Salon.com, O the Oprah Magazine, Field and Stream, and the annual anthologies Best American Travel Writing and Best Food Writing.</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Steven Rinella is an outdoorsman, author, and host of the top-rated podcast and TV series, <em>MeatEater</em>.&nbsp;Steven has spoken to a wide range of audiences about his life as a modern-day hunter-gatherer.
