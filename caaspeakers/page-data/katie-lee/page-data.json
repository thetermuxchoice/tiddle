Raised in a modest, tight-knit West Virginia family, each evening centered around the dinner menu. Eager to get involved, Katie began cooking at the tender age of 4 under the guidance of her mentor Grandma Dora. Using fresh vegetables from her grandpa’s garden and meat from the family’s cattle and pig farms, Katie quickly learned the value of seasonal ingredients. Katie’s latest book <i>Endless Summer Cookbook</i> debuted April 14, 2015. Her first cookbook, <i>The Comfort Table</i>, was released in 2008, soon followed by <i>The Comfort Table: Recipes for Everyday Occasions</i> (2009). In addition to her cookbooks, she published her first novel, <i>Groundswell</i>, in 2011. In addition to <i>The Kitchen</i>, Katie can be seen regularly on Food Network shows <i>Best. Ever.</i> and <i>Beat Bobby Flay.</i> Outside of her culinary and literary adventures, Katie sits on the Celebrity Board for Feeding America and is an active support for 96 Elephants. When not working or volunteering, she enjoys surfing, traveling and playing with her pug, Fionula. She resides in the Hamptons and Tribeca.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Host, Food Network's <em>The Kitchen</em></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Carla Hall","partyId":"9AD00C12-55A0-4CD3-AC06-B8529B79CDD9","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Chef, Best Selling Author and Television Personality</p>\n","friendlyId":"carla-hall"},{"name":"Ted Allen","partyId":"ABE05D77-BE48-452D-9297-CB506B6FD9C1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning Host, <em>Chopped </em>&amp;<em> </em><em>Chopped Junior</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"ted-allen"},{"name":"Amy Matthews","partyId":"92799F87-ED8E-4F60-A04A-DE6B536941B1","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Host, HGTV's \"Renovation Raiders\" &amp; DIY's \"Sweat Equity\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"amy-matthews"},{"name":"David Chang","partyId":"B19D1017-D170-40AF-BE5D-0EBC7A24D7BA","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Chef, Momofuku</p>\n","friendlyId":"david-chang"},{"name":"Roy Choi","partyId":"B56307AD-997B-455A-994E-1244334FE395","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Social Activist, Chef, and Co-Founder of Kogi Truck</p>\n","friendlyId":"roy-choi"},{"name":"Joy Bauer","partyId":"E4A076A9-1837-4435-849B-40C3C447BAC7","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Nutrition and Healthy Lifestyle Expert, NBC’s&nbsp;<em>TODAY</em>&nbsp;<em>Show</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Health + Happiness</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"joy-bauer"}],"topics":["Health & Wellness"],"types":["Chefs","Lifestyle"]}}},
