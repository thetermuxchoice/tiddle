Among such projects is <i>We the People, </i>a groundbreaking animated series of music videos covering a range of U.S. civics lessons that debuted earlier this year. Produced alongside Barack and Michelle Obama and creator Chris Nee, the series combines the power of music and animation with the hope of inspiring, educating and activating a new generation of young Americans. This September, Barris and Khalabo released their first project in the documentary space with Netflix’s <i>Blood Brothers: Malcolm X &amp; Muhammad Ali</i>, a documentary feature exploring the extraordinary friendship between Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali directed by Marcus A.
