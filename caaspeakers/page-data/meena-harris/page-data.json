As the founder of the groundbreaking brand, Phenomenal, as well as an author, and lawyer, Harris is a respected entrepreneur and an influential voice for gender and racial equity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In January 2021, Harris released her second book,&nbsp;<em>Ambitious Girl,</em> becoming a #1 New York Times bestselling author.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Harris' legal expertise is in the areas of consumer protection, data privacy, and cybersecurity. She is a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School and currently resides in San Francisco with her partner and two daughters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Phenomenal </strong></p>\n\n<p>Phenomenal is a female-powered lifestyle brand that has been bringing awareness to social causes.&nbsp; Phenomenal launched on International Women’s Day 2017 with the expectation that it would last just one month for Women’s History Month. Instead, on the first day, the campaign remarkably sold 2,500 t-shirts to benefit its nonprofit partners and has grown ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Phenomenal is a 360-degree media company&nbsp;that aims to amplify the stories and experiences of women and underrepresented communities. Through content creation, brand partnerships, book clubs, and more, Harris and Phenomenal are leading a cultural shift to a more inclusive and equitable media landscape and world.&nbsp;Over the past four years, the brand has launched partnerships with LIFEWTR, Starz, Amazon Originals, Netflix, Johnnie Walker, Shondaland, Visa, First Aid Beauty, Midol, Beats, Nordstrom, Sienna Naturals, Flo, Audible, the Discovery Channel, Salesforce, and the WNBA—and has received support from more than 1,000 celebrities, athletes, and thought leaders, from Serena Williams, Dwyane Wade, and Issa Rae, to Dove Cameron, Mindy Kaling, and Samuel L. Jackson, among others. By lifting up the voices, experiences, and talents of women—with women of color at the forefront—Phenomenal is building community, shifting dialogue, and shaping culture.</p>\n\n<p>While the original Phenomenal t-shirts are Phenomenal's flagship, viral product, the platform has since expanded and regularly works to grow its impact and connection with the socially-minded women who support it. For example, to deepen engagement with women professionals, Phenomenal launched a \"tech tour\" at major companies throughout Silicon Valley, including Airbnb, Google, Salesforce, and Uber. The tech tour program evolved into a fireside-chat series and other community events aimed at highlighting women in leadership and inspiring meaningful discussions around advancing equity and opportunity in the workplace.</p>\n\n<p>Phenomenal also has curated over 30 pop-up portrait studios across the country, providing access to a simple and often overlooked tool for women in the digital space. In addition to always working to increase its impact work, and to provide a tangible connection to a larger community of women, Phenomenal has proven to be particularly effective at urgent moments in our society. Along with the original Phenomenal t-shirt, Phenomenal has launched other activism-focused campaigns and products, including #1600men, Phenomenal Voter, Phenomenally Black, Phenomenally Indigenous, and Phenomenally Latina, with plans to continue to grow and expand.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Founder &amp; CEO, Phenomenal; <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author, <em>Ambitious Girl</em></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It was an incredible event!&nbsp;It couldn't have gone any better in our minds.&nbsp;She is truly a Phenomenal&nbsp;woman!&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Social Finance, Inc (SoFi)"}},{"text":"<p>Meena's complementary visions for philanthropy, activism and government not only shared what must be done to restore our economy and address deep racial and economic inequality, but also illustrated how these sectors must work together to make change possible.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Prosperity Now"}},{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span>Meena was great.
