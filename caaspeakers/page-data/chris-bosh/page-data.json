His extraordinary career ended not at a time of his choosing but “in a doctor’s office in the middle of the afternoon.” Forced to reckon with how to find meaning to carry forward, he found himself looking back over his path, from a teenager in Dallas who balanced basketball with the high school robotics club to the pinnacle of the NBA and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>In his 2021 memoir&nbsp;<em>Letters to a Young Athlete</em>, Bosh&nbsp;chronicles that amazing journey&nbsp;and shares the many lesson he learned through many trials and tribulations.&nbsp;Reflecting on all he learned from a long list of basketball legends, from LeBron and Kobe to Pat Riley and Coach K, he saw that his important lessons weren’t about basketball so much as the inner game of success—right attitude, right commitment, right flow within a team. Now he shares that journey, giving us a fascinating view from the inside of what greatness feels like and what it takes, formulated as a series of letters to younger people coming up and to all wisdom seekers. A timeless gift for anyone in pursuit of excellence, Letters to a Young Athlete offers a proven path for taming your inner voice and making it your ally, through the challenges of failure and the challenges of success alike.</p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Bosh fell in love with basketball at an early age and even earned the prestigious “Mr. Basketball” title all while maintaining an admirable GPA which eventually landed him at the Georgia Institute of Technology. While academia remained a significant portion of Bosh’s DNA, he made the decision to leave Georgia Tech, after being named ACC Rookie of the Year, to pursue his athletic dreams, entering the 2003 NBA draft. While he notes that this was a difficult transition and he certainly missed the collegiate experience he had left behind, he also credits this experience as one that helped him build an abundance of resilience and&nbsp; strength.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The decision proved to be a fruitful one and impressively, Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in a draft class that included multiple future NBA stars such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony. During his time with the Raptors, Bosh became a five time NBA All Star, appeared for the US national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics) and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. Bosh relished in the opportunity to be humbled each and every day; he went from being the best on the court to competing amongst the best in the&nbsp; world, and the experience began shaping the man he is today.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2010, Bosh made one of the more notable moves in his career, leaving Toronto for the Miami HEAT as the franchise’s all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, double doubles, free throws made and attempted and minutes played. The much anticipated decision meant that Bosh would be joining forces with current Miami HEAT star Dwyane Wade, and NBA All Star LeBron James, who would also be moving over to the team, creating what became known as “The Big Three.” This also marked one of the most memorable free agency periods in the modern day NBA. Once “The Big Three” made it official, fans even dubbed the team&nbsp; “The Heatles,” as they had quickly become the greatest show in sports. The entrance of “The Big Three” played an incredibly important part of Miami culture and history, bringing a level of excitement that was both palpable and constant to the city, and offering a resurgence to what is known as HEAT Nation. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>During his time with the HEAT, Bosh won two back-to-back NBA titles in 2012 and 2013 before playing his final game in February of 2016 prior to a medical condition which no longer allowed him to pursue his career on the court. He attributes his time as a rebounder with teaching him to become a fighter, and he continues to employ his fighting spirit in all of his pursuits. By the end of his basketball career he was also an 11-time NBA All-Star and the NBA’s first Global Ambassador of Basketball. In March of 2019, Bosh’s #1 Jersey was officially retired, earning his spot in rafters and in everyone’s heart as a forever HEAT lifer. Most recently Bosh was named as a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2021</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to his basketball career, in 2004, Bosh decided to pursue his passions in the sports and education arenas amongst youths by setting up the Chris Bosh Foundation, which is now known as “Team Tomorrow.” He regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading and received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign. Bosh continues his mission with Team Tomorrow and is constantly supporting the community in Miami and beyond. Helping people and serving as a good example to both his own children along with children in the community remains an integral part of Bosh’s personality.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Throughout his basketball career and thereafter, Bosh has proven to be quite dynamic, pursuing his interests in the arts by taking on several acting roles in shows including HBO’s Entourage, Parks &amp; Recreation and Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. He also learned to play guitar and is and has both written and produced music including serving as co-producer for Gucci Mane’s “Miss My Woe.” Always looking to further expand his capabilities, Bosh also became bilingual during his time in Miami, dedicating himself to learning the Spanish language.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2011, Bosh married the love of his life Adrienne Williams. Bosh has five children and the family resides in Austin, remaining active in the local community. While he no longer spends time on-the-court, Bosh continues to pursue passions for travel, music, philanthropy and fatherhood. Today, Bosh is happy, healthy and ready to explore his life outside of basketball. Both the ultimate rebounder and fighter, Bosh is back on his feet, standing strong and ready to chase some new gold trophies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>NBA Hall of Famer, Two-Time NBA World Champion &amp; 11-time NBA All Star</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Dwyane Wade","partyId":"21D4D006-352C-4230-9587-E762C1EC9FCE","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>NBA Champion, Former Miami Heat Guard &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n","friendlyId":"dwyane-wade"},{"name":"Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson","partyId":"85483E69-9EAA-4A4E-BC42-F6AB3635B9C4","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Basketball Legend &amp; Businessman</p>\n","friendlyId":"earvin-magic-johnson"},{"name":"Carmelo Anthony","partyId":"F04AFB17-79D5-4677-827E-C4EEA02CDF76","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Ten-Time NBA All-Star, Two-Time Olympic Gold Medalist &amp; Entrepreneur</p>","friendlyId":"carmelo-anthony"},{"name":"Chris Paul","partyId":"5AD1127D-A121-485D-9D24-55892FFE528C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Phoenix Suns Point Guard &amp; Former&nbsp;NBA Players Association President</p>\n","friendlyId":"chris-paul"},{"name":"Grant Hill","partyId":"2994849A-5A27-45A5-BD7C-F7834613B789","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Vice Chairman of the Atlanta Hawks and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","friendlyId":"grant-hill"},{"name":"Udonis Haslem","partyId":"6CD48E0E-CA89-4312-8BC2-B09A3CF213CA","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Power Forward, Miami Heat</p>\n","friendlyId":"udonis-haslem"}],"topics":["Diversity⸒ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Black History & Culture","Mental Health","Science & Technology","Sports - * Headliners","Sports - Basketball","Sports - Olympians"],"types":["* Featured Speakers","Athletes"]}}},
