Whether it’s on-screen playing dynamic characters or in off-screen interviews, he tackles political and social issues with comedic brilliance.</p>\n\n<p>Morris is best known for his breakout role as “Winston Bishop,” a black LAPD officer in the comedy series&nbsp;<em>New Girl</em>. Although his character’s occupation was not the center of his storyline, Morris spoke out on his discomfort playing a police officer during a time filled with unnecessary, harrowing police brutality. The role allowed Morris to touch on the political and social issues suffocating society.</p>\n\n<p>In his new show&nbsp;<em>Woke</em>, Morris depicts famous cartoonist Keith Knight. Like Knight, Morris seeks to enlighten through laughter, no matter how heavy or serious the material. He recognizes the much-needed arrival of a show like Woke during these turbulent times and is pleased with the conversations it has sparked.</p>\n\n<p>Lamorne Morris is a playbook definition of starting from the bottom and eventually making it big. Now the star of Hulu sitcom&nbsp;<em>Woke</em>, Morris waited tables at a diner while studying at Second City before landing his role on&nbsp;<em>New Girl</em>. Morris further unveiled his talents through roles in blockbuster films, including&nbsp;<em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Bloodshot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In his characters and through off-screen appearances, Morris navigates tough conversations openly, a needed skill in today’s times. Whether it is the cultural impact he has depicting the “black guy in the friend group” in New Girl or the racism he encountered growing up on the south side of Chicago, Morris is committed to activating socially relevant and politically rich conversations.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Comedic Actor,&nbsp;<em>New Girl&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Woke</em></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Trevor Noah","partyId":"7A5C0F29-E605-4B78-931F-E3AEC0A1BDDF","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning Comedian Known for Hosting&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show</em>​​​​</p>","friendlyId":"trevor-noah"},{"name":"Jordan Peele","partyId":"66F4EF59-8768-427F-93BC-7CCD3335B9EF","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Comedian, Actor, &amp; Filmmaker</p>\n","friendlyId":"jordan-peele"},{"name":"Kenya Barris","partyId":"3F171D4A-8C35-45E5-B791-F2B251C8B232","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Creator, Executive Producer &amp; Co-Showrunner,&nbsp;<em>Black-ish</em>&nbsp;&amp; <em>Grown-ish, </em>Actor &amp; Creator,&nbsp;<em>#blackAF</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"kenya-barris"},{"name":"Winston Duke","partyId":"28A11488-1594-459C-A43E-69A04F894F61","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Actor;&nbsp;<em>Us, Black Panther </em>&amp;<em> </em><span><span><span><span><span><em>Avengers: End Game</em></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","friendlyId":"winston-duke"},{"name":"Sterling K.
