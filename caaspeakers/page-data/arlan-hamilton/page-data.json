Since its founding, Backstage has raised nearly $30 million and invested in 200 startups led by underestimated founders.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton founded talent operations startup Runner to connect outstanding operations talent with inclusive companies. Runner has already raised $2 million from investors like Precursor Ventures, Lunar Startups, Kapor Capital, and others. That same year, Backstage Capital saw one of its first true exits when ice cream startup Coolhaus sold to The Urgent Company.</p>\n\n<p>Arlan had an untraditional path into tech. Prior to starting Backstage Capital and Runner, Arlan authored the blog &ldquo;Your Daily Lesbian Moment,&rdquo; which she grew to a monthly readership of 50,000 fans worldwide. She also worked in the music industry as a tour coordinator for artists like Toni Braxton and Jason Derulo. Since entering the tech industry, Arlan has received a number of accolades in media publications like Fortune, Vanity Fair, and Fast Company.</p>\n\n<p>Arlan published her book, <em>It&rsquo;s About Damn Time</em>, detailing her journey from homelessness to venture capital. Arlan also hosts podcasts <em>Your First Million</em>&nbsp;and <em>Demystifying Faith</em>&nbsp;and is the executive producer on&nbsp;<em>The Valley</em>,&nbsp;a daily soap opera that is described as&nbsp;<em>General Hospital</em>&nbsp;for the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton differentiates herself from others in the tech industry by not being afraid to go against the grain. Case in point: Backstage Capital, under Hamilton&rsquo;s leadership, raised nearly $5 million in one week through an equity crowdfunding campaign. The historic campaign created an opportunity for everyday people to invest in Backstage&rsquo;s operations and benefit from Backstage&rsquo;s future success. In doing so, Hamilton has also created a blueprint for other underestimated fund managers.</p>\n\n<p>Arlan is a proponent of paying it forward and supporting other underestimated people in the tech industry and beyond. She&rsquo;s a limited partner in funds at Collab Capital, Ganas Ventures, Lightship Capital, RareBreed Ventures, and several others. Meanwhile, Arlan and her mother, Mrs. Earline Butler-Sims, founded a scholarship program for Black students at Oxford University and HBCU Dillard University.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Serial Entrepreneur and Founder of Backstage Capital &amp; Runner</p>","title":""}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Eric Ries","partyId":"238681E9-C2D6-4E85-A150-CAD3AE74E127","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Entrepreneur &amp; Author, <em>The Lean Startup</em> &amp; <em>The Startup Way</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"eric-ries"},{"name":"Barbara Corcoran","partyId":"53F8BF00-EDFB-4DE5-8272-87A43012960D","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Real Estate Mogul, Business Expert &amp; Investor on ABC’s <em>Shark Tank</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"barbara-corcoran"},{"name":"Mellody Hobson","partyId":"8FF6714C-B43C-48AD-8C59-E5129A261B33","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>President, Ariel Investments</p>\n","friendlyId":"mellody-hobson"},{"name":"Shervin Pishevar","partyId":"51B2D65E-A818-4A90-A812-FD20AC8A7C28","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Managing Partner, Sherpa Ventures</p>\n","friendlyId":"shervin-pishevar"},{"name":"Sallie Krawcheck","partyId":"E569A00A-3F24-4667-8C9A-4045CD58653F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Ellevest</p>\n","friendlyId":"sallie-krawcheck"},{"name":"Arian Simone","partyId":"65E761A6-CB3D-491B-A484-E74660A68AD2","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Serial Entrepreneur &amp; Bestselling Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"arian-simone"}],"topics":["Inspirational Stories","E-Commerce","Economy","Black History & Culture","LGBTQIA+ Advocacy","Science & Technology","Team Building","Women's Empowerment"],"types":["Business Leaders","Entrepreneurs","Founders / CEOs","Inspiring Women","Women Business Leaders"]}}},
