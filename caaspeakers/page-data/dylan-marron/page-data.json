For several years, Dylan Marron has taken the opposite approach: address it head-on by calling up some of the people behind the hateful messages.</p>\n\n<p>In his talks, Dylan walks his audience through the steps he took to foster radical empathy for a group of people many advised him to ignore, and how we can bring that practice into our own lives and relationships, digital or not.</p>","title":"Fostering Radical Empathy"},{"text":"<p>Online hate and online shame may be different beasts, but, as Dylan identifies, they thrive off of the same digital rewards systems. The topic of &quot;cancel culture&quot; is a divisive one&mdash;some argue it&#39;s the work of a specific political side, others consider it to be a righteous tool, and a third group contends it doesn&#39;t even exist. Dylan navigates this tricky tightrope with nuance, parsing out the harm of online shame without generalization or stigmatization, and identifies ways that we can all unknowingly take part in it and, helpfully, escape it.</p>","title":"Creating Alternatives To Online Shame"},{"text":"<p>One of Dylan&#39;s main points is that debate doesn&#39;t work, because it&#39;s gamified conversation that promises a winner and loser at the end. But, he asks, what does winning a debate actually do? Does it change minds or does it simply offer a spectacle of opposition? Dylan helpfully breaks down the way conversations can veer into debate territory, and how to redirect them into productive, meaningful dialogue.</p>","title":"Avoiding Debate & Embracing Conversation"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Dylan Marron is a writer and content creator known as the host and producer of the critically-acclaimed podcast<i> Conversations with People Who Hate Me</i>.</li>\n\t<li>The podcast is a social experiment that brings together adversarial internet strangers through phone calls and it inspired his TED Talk,<i> &ldquo;</i>Empathy is Not Endorsement,&rdquo; viewed by millions worldwide.</li>\n\t<li>With the success of the podcast, Dylan turned the experience into a book, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9260995/type/dlg/sid/1296054lgbtqiabooksgoodreads/https:/www.barnesandnoble.com/w/conversations-with-people-who-hate-me-dylan-marron/1140208949\"><i>Conversations with People Who Hate Me: 12 Things I Learned from Talking to Internet Strangers</i></a>,<i> </i>about<i> </i>finding common ground with people you never thought possible.</li>\n\t<li>He is also the creator of the Shorty Award-nominated video series,<i> Every Single Word</i>, which edits down popular films to feature only the words spoken by people of color, highlighting the need for diversity in Hollywood.</li>\n\t<li>Dylan created, hosted, and produced <i>Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People, Shutting Down Bullsh*t, and the Unboxing series</i>.</li>\n\t<li>A popular speaker at universities, Dylan has designed courses for The Obama Foundation, the Wall Street Journal, and TED and addresses topics ranging from online shame to diversity as an asset, dialogue across differences, the role of social media in polarization, &ldquo;radical empathy,&rdquo; and the power of wielding softness as strength.</li>\n</ul>","title":""}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Writer and content creator Dylan Marron has been described as a &quot;modern Mister Rodgers for the digital age.&quot; He hosts and produces the critically-acclaimed podcast<em> Conversations with People Who Hate Me</em>, a social experiment that brings together adversarial internet strangers through phone calls, fostering connection at a time of division and digital isolation.
