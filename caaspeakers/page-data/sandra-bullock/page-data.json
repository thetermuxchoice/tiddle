Earlier last year, she led an all-star cast of women including Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling and Awkwafina in the heist comedy “Ocean’s 8.” The film, which was produced by Steven Soderbergh had the best opening weekend in franchise history.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2014, she received her second Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress, for her performance as Dr. Ryan Stone in the critically acclaimed sci-fi thriller “Gravity,” directed by Alfonso Cuaron.

Earning $723 million worldwide, “Gravity” is Bullock’s highest-grossing film and her most critically acknowledged, winning seven Academy Awards.
