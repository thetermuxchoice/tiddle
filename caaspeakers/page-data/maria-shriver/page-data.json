In addition to being a Peabody and Emmy Award-winning journalist and producer, a seven-time New York Times&nbsp;bestselling </span></span></span><a href=\"http://www.mariashriver.com/books\"><span><span><span><span><span>author</span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span> and an NBC News special anchor, Maria is also the founder of the for-benefit media enterprise Shriver Media. Shriver Media believes media can be used as a force for good in the world. Under Maria’s leadership, Shriver Media produces digital content, email newsletters, podcasts, live events, books, documentaries and films that ignite hearts and minds.<strong> </strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to her award-winning journalism career, Maria has also been a long-time champion for empowering women. While serving as the First Lady of California from 2003 to 2010, she produced the iconic Women’s Conference, which under her leadership grew into the largest women’s conference in the world. The Women’s Conference raised millions of dollars that funded scholarships, supported domestic violence and poverty initiatives, and single-handedly revived the California History Museum. One of The Women’s Conference’s many features was the Minerva Awards, which Maria created to honor and support women who made extraordinary contributions to all walks of life, from the arts to community activism to business and innovation. Women bestowed with the honor included the likes of Sandra Day O’Connor, Billie Jean King, Gloria Steinem and Oprah Winfrey, to name just a few.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Maria’s groundbreaking Shriver Reports have also changed the conversations around women, work, poverty and Alzheimer’s in America. In 2009, she published the widely-quoted “The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Changes Everything,” which revealed that, for the first time in our nation’s history, women represented half of all U.S. workers and were two-thirds of the nation’s primary breadwinners. In 2010, “The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Takes on Alzheimer’s,” in partnership with the Alzheimer’s Association, publicly reported for the first time that two-thirds of all Alzheimer’s diagnoses are women. In 2014, she published “The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back From the Brink,” which reported that the new face of poverty in America was that of a working woman. The report revealed that 42 million working American women were living at or below the brink of poverty, as well as the 28 million children who depend on them. One such woman, Katrina Gilbert, was the subject of the Emmy-nominated HBO documentary that Maria executive produced, “Paycheck to Paycheck: The Life and Times of Katrina Gilbert.” Each Shriver Report has changed laws and ignited national conversations about the changing status of women across our society.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, Maria has also been a megaphone for educating the public about the disproportionate effect that Alzheimer’s disease has on women and has become one of the nation’s leading advocates for Alzheimer’s, families and caregivers. She founded the nonprofit organization The Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement to raise awareness and funding for this critical issue, but also to ignite conversations around prevention and inspire much-needed personal, professional and political change. She has also worked tirelessly to advocate for America’s caregivers, two-thirds of which are also women. Maria regularly uses her voice and her platforms (including her post as an NBC News special anchor) to report on stories surrounding the brain and the latest cutting-edge information about neuroscience. In 2017, the Alzheimer’s Association honored Maria with its first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award for her passion, leadership and dedication to </span></span></span><span><span><span>leading the way to a world without Alzheimer's. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of that mission, in 2021, she co-founded along with her son, Patrick Schwarzenegger, the brain health and wellness company MOSH—a company that strives to create a conversation about brain health through food, education, research, and providing the tools for a “mindstyle” lifestyle.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Maria has also written New York Times-bestselling books and produced award-winning film and TV programs that have furthered the public’s understanding of this disease.</span> <span><span><span>She executive produced the Academy Award-winning film “Still Alice” and HBO's Emmy Award-winning \"The Alzheimer's Project,\" with the Emmy-Award winning segment \"Grandpa, Do You Know Who I Am?,\" which was inspired by her award-winning children’s book “What’s Happening to Grandpa?” </span></span></span><span><span><span>She also published the first-of-its-kind coloring book, “Color Your Mind,” that is specifically designed to engage individuals with Alzheimer’s and the people who care for and love them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2018, Shriver authored the instant No. 1 New York Times-bestselling book “I’ve Been Thinking… Reflections, Prayers and Meditations for a Meaningful Life.” </span></span></span><span><span><span>A shining example of using one’s platform and career accomplishments to positively impact the world, Maria aims to motivate everyone to lead an inspired life and channel their passions into meaningful contributions that make a difference in the world.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span>Acclaimed</span></span> <span><span>Journalist, Bestselling Author, Entrepreneur, &amp; Former First Lady of California</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Hoda Kotb","partyId":"0B90E32B-1C5C-4C90-A7CD-C2611C4CAD41","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Anchor,&nbsp;NBC News' <em>TODAY</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","friendlyId":"hoda-kotb"},{"name":"Amy Robach","partyId":"C4035C96-FE84-4D40-91B5-97B857D6D97B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">Co-Anchor, ABC News&rsquo; GMA3: What You Need To Know &amp; Bestselling Author of&nbsp;<i>Better</i></p>","friendlyId":"amy-robach"},{"name":"Gayle King","partyId":"29412D6E-9E30-4A36-8E4A-5AAD3F088B57","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Host,&nbsp;<em>CBS This Morning</em>&nbsp;and Editor-at-Large,&nbsp;<em>Oprah Daily</em></p>","friendlyId":"gayle-king"},{"name":"Lisa Damour, Ph.D.","partyId":"8EBBE935-94D2-42CD-8FDD-D4819B93C855","speakerNameSubheading":"<p><span><span><span>World-Renowned Psychologist &amp; Bestselling Author</span></span></span></p>\n","friendlyId":"lisa-damour-phd"},{"name":"Maye Musk","partyId":"FE564820-517C-4FFE-A35F-3FF14905414C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>World-Renowned Dietician, Model, Entrepreneur &amp; Bestselling Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"maye-musk"},{"name":"Selma Blair","partyId":"03F4A727-66AD-40DC-AFD7-0CFC400D8FB0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p><span><span><span><span><span>Actress, Bestselling Author, and Disability Rights Advocate</span></span></span></span></span></p>","friendlyId":"selma-blair"}],"topics":["Health & Wellness","Inspirational Stories","Mental Health","News & Media","Philanthropy","Women's Empowerment","Women's Health"],"types":["Bestselling Authors","Inspiring Women","Motivational"]}}},
