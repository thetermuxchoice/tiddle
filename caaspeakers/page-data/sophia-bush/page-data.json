She’s founded voting rights organizations and has been a powerful voice for racial justice and pay equity. Along the way, advisers, family members, and friends have said, “C’mon, pick a lane!” These days, Sophia has a firm response to this: “WelI, I do care about everything, and you should too.” In this talk, Sophia outlines her philosophy that activism and volunteerism is not a part of your life, it’s a way of doing life. In a TED-style manifesto, she advocates for a holistic view of the world, one that acknowledges the interconnectivity of various issues and no longer demands that young people pick a lane. Drawing from her own experiences, Sophia invites audiences to dare to care about everything.</p>\n","title":"How to Care About Everything"},{"text":"<p>Ever wonder how to fix traffic in your neighborhood? Update your public school’s curriculum? Get new park benches? There’s a vote for that! Almost every aspect of our communities’ well-being ladders back out to local elections—and Sophia wants to make sure that Americans are harnessing the full potential of that power. After campaigning for dozens of local candidates, going on the road with the Obamas, and joining Hillary Clinton’s campaign, she founded the voter registration organization I Am a Voter to get every American to recognize their responsibility to engage with all levels of elections, and more importantly, recognize voting as an act of agency and hope. This speech is a rallying cry to every American to use our voices to make the communities and country we want.</p>\n","title":"Why I Am a Voter (and You Should Be Too)"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Sophia Bush is an American actress, activist, entrepreneur, and global education access advocate.</li>\n\t<li>Bush&nbsp;has starred in various independent projects, shows and movies such as the hit comedy John Tucker Must Die,&nbsp;Incredibles 2, The CW&rsquo;s hit drama&nbsp;<em>One Tree Hill</em>, and starred as &quot;Detective Erin Lindsay&quot; for 4 seasons on Dick Wolf&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Chicago PD</em>.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Named one of the most charitable celebrities by CNN, Sophia devotes her free time to bettering girl&rsquo;s education and the environment.
