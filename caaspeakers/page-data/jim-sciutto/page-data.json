The United States and the West face an ever-growing and daunting slate of foreign policy challenges: a nuclear North Korea as well as nuclear advancement in Iran and the Gulf; an increasingly aggressive China and Russia; instability and division in Europe and the need to address global concerns such as climate change, cybersecurity, and the advance of new technologies including artificial intelligence and space weapons. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>CNN Chief National Security Correspondent and Anchor Jim Sciutto gives a global overview of risks and opportunities to be on the lookout for in the upcoming year. This tour around the world is very effective for business audiences investing worldwide. As a foreign correspondent based in Europe, the Middle East and Asia for more than two decades, the former chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to China, and now covering national security for CNN, Sciutto provides a unique, on-the-ground perspective from each crisis zone around the globe and far beyond the news desk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"What Keeps US Spies Up at Night: America’s (and the World’s) Five Biggest National Security Threats"},{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span>Jim Sciutto, CNN Anchor and Chief National Security Correspondent, reveals the invisible fronts of a twenty-first century war underway on the US and takes audiences right to the frontlines of battles being waged—often without the public’s full knowledge—from cyber attacks to disinformation campaigns to ground invasions in Europe to war in space.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>The United States is currently under attack from multiple adversaries—yet most Americans have no idea of the dangers threatening us. In this eye-opening presentation based on his book, Sciutto traces the expanding web of attacks that together amount to an undeclared but deeply dangerous war on America. America is engaged in a Shadow War on multiple fronts, with multiple enemies, principally Russia and China, whose aim is to weaken and overcome the United States and the global system it has built and defended since the end of World War Two. But unlike conventional warfare, these conflicts are conducted in the shadows, with no formal declaration. In fact, The Shadow War is designed explicitly to remain below the threshold of a shooting war with the US.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Sciutto takes audiences on the ground to several fronts of this war - from a spy plane over the South China Sea to a nuclear submarine under the Arctic to the battlefields of Eastern Ukraine, inside Russia’s 2016 election interference and China’s ongoing theft of US secrets right up into space, where Russia and China are deploying space weapons – all skirmishes in a new and much larger superpower war. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>But America is adapting and fighting back. In&nbsp;</span></span><em><span><span><span>The Shadow War</span></span></span></em><span><span>, Sciutto introduces the dizzying array of soldiers, sailors, submariners and their commanders, space engineers, computer scientists, and civilians who are on the front lines of this new kind of forever war. Understand how these countries and governments, particularly Russia and China, are conducting these attacks, creating national security, business risks and risks to America’s democracy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"The Shadow War"},{"text":"<p>The US-China trade war has upended the world’s most crucial economic relationship and threatened to send the world economy into recession. For two years, Jim Sciutto was at the center of the US-China trade dispute while Chief of Staff to the US Ambassador to China and in the years since then, covering the broader relationship as Chief National Security Correspondent and Anchor for CNN, including multiple assignments in China and interviews with US and Chinese officials. At the core are differences that each country sees as essential to its economic health and national security – differences that are therefore difficult to impossible to resolve without concessions that both countries are loth to make. In addition, domestic political pressure in both countries prevent US and Chinese leaders from being perceived as caving to pressure from the other side. The combination makes progress on a wide-ranging deal difficult, with enormous implications for the US, China and the world.</p>\n","title":"The US-China Trade War"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Jim Sciutto is CNN's chief national security correspondent and co-anchor of <em>CNN Newsroom</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>He reports and provides analysis across the network's programs and platforms on all aspects of U.S. national security including foreign policy, the military, intelligence community, and the ongoing Russia investigation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li>Sciutto's most recent book, <em>The Shadow War:&nbsp;Inside Russia's and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America</em>,&nbsp;reveals the invisible fronts that make up 21st century warfare, from disinformation campaigns to advanced satellite weapons.</li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>He has reported from throughout Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Arctic with the U.S. military and senior U.S. leaders and played a key role in&nbsp;CNN's&nbsp;overseas coverage of the Charlie Hebdo and Paris terrorist attacks in France and the violent elections in the Ukraine.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sciutto's one-hour CNN special,&nbsp;<em>Targeting Terror: Inside the Intelligence War</em>, was recognized with a 2016 Headliner Award.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>He was also awarded the George Polk Award and a citation for Excellence from the Overseas Press Club for his undercover reporting from Myanmar, and&nbsp;his reporting for the series&nbsp;<em>Iraq: Where Things Stand</em>&nbsp;was recognized with an Emmy Award for two consecutive years.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Jim Sciutto is CNN's chief national security correspondent and co-anchor of <em>CNN Newsroom</em> airing Monday through Friday from 9 to 11 a.m. ET alongside Poppy Harlow.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>He reports and provides analysis across the network's programs and platforms on all aspects of U.S. national security including foreign policy, the military, intelligence community, and the ongoing Russia investigation.
