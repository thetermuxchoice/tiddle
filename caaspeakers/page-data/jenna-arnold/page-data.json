Many of us find ourselves either arguing unproductively or completely avoiding issues that deeply impact our lives and society in the future. We are more informed and technologically connected now than ever before, yet our ability to have open, honest, and respectful dialogue across differing perspectives seems increasingly more at risk.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It is time to get clear on the specific roadblocks getting in the way of reaching your maximized potential professionally and personally. This workshop provides turn-key tools to have those conversations productively (key word!).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Using the best strategies for navigating confrontation, defusing defensiveness, and finding common ground in shared values, this workshop teaches participants how to do the hard work: communicate through conflict.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","title":"Workshop: Communicating Through Conflict"},{"text":"<p>Jenna Arnold, author of <em>Raising Our Hand:&nbsp;How White Women Can Stop Avoiding Hard Conversations</em>, Start Accepting Responsibility, and Find Our Place on the New Frontlines, shares her personal journey and proprietary research to help women understand what holds them back and how to navigate their insecurities.</p>\n\n<p>With audiences, she examines the sources of American women’s belief in perfection, their role in society, and how they can create more meaningful lives and careers.</p>\n\n<p>She also dives into the many contradictions of ourselves. Because of a fear of “getting it wrong,” and “avoiding the tension” or “maintaining the peace,” women regularly table their power and influence on the sidelines — when it could be used to save lives, including their own. These same women often want to step in, to be heard, and to help. But they don’t know how. The result? They opt out of taking action altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Geared towards women throughout the corporate spectrum, this talk is a call-to-action for upper management to learn how to tap into the extraordinary pools of talent they likely have on their payroll who are just too insecure to raise their hands. She helps leaders and audiences understand how their influence, power, and voice can better serve those most in need, and how they can take an active role in creating a better future.</p>\n\n<p><em>*This speech is suited for corporations, high school, and university audiences, and particularly women. This can also be customized and structured as a workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n","title":"Raise Your Hand (and Your Bottom Line)"},{"text":"<p>As co-founder of one of the “biggest ideas in social change” according to The New York Times, and lauded by Oprah as one of the \"100 Awakened Leaders who are using their voice and talent to elevate humanity,\" Jenna Arnold has relied on creativity to be the driving force behind authentic and sustained social change.</p>\n\n<p>Building a constituency of supporters inside and outside of a target industry is key to achieving goals. Arnold has taken some of the hardest-to-grasp concepts and simplified the message — through storytelling and design — to get the attention of presidents, international governments, and Main Street USA to meet long-term objectives and make real change happen.</p>\n\n<p><em>*This speech is geared toward entrepreneurs, politicians, senior business leaders, international government agencies, and can also be customized and structured as a workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n","title":"Creativity to Drive Change"},{"text":"<p>Since organizing the Women’s March of 2017, Jenna Arnold has worked with a number of behavioral and crowd scientists to identify who, why, and how people are showing up to the often-charged conversations of our time.</p>\n\n<p>While the country has never seen this level of “activism” and participation before, Arnold challenges the common understanding of where the frontlines of democratic work actually lives. No longer is it just in the voting booth or in the halls on Capitol Hill. Americans are taking action from inside their homes and businesses. They are creating organic movements, enlisting others, and working in unsuspecting groups — asking questions about their role and impact on the world with regard to diversity, bias, societal norms that need to be broken, and legacy.</p>\n\n<p>With audiences, Arnold explores these newly-structured questions and the best ways to catapult ourselves individually and collectively to best-practice answers.</p>\n\n<p><em>*This speech is geared toward diversity and inclusion, health and wellness, politics and policy, and world affairs events. The idea is that we need to be working in a lane that, traditionally, societies and institutions haven’t. This can also be customized to be a full-day workshop with business leaders, board meetings, and executive briefings.&nbsp;</em></p>\n","title":"The New Frontlines of Democracy"},{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Our Black communities are tired of struggling to be heard. And our Black sisters often carry the heaviest burden of all. And it's time for white women to speak up—even if they don't know how difficult this will be. It's time to move the work beyond allyship and fight against complacency—in our homes, our behaviors, and our own minds.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's time to move beyond protests and petitions. It's time to take the steps beyond corporate statements. It's time for white women to become students of racial inequity to understand how they benefit within these oppressive systems and learn how to dismantle the inequities Black women face. White women are afraid to say the wrong thing and don't know exactly where to start.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Denise and Jenna will lead women through this tough conversation on how individuals can contribute and make an authentic impact on systematic racism.

Making these statements may bring attention to the leadership team, marketing campaigns, supply chain and diversity and inclusion practices.

The time to push beyond the confines of comfortable conversations on race, is NOW.

In this session Jenna will walk us through the historical lies we were taught that have been comfortably tucked in the pages of our textbooks for generations. The lies we tell ourselves as a result of the societal rules and structures designed around us and how we can, in peeling back the layers of the myths that have propped up the narrative about the United States, start to rebuild a foundation of truth that is sturdy enough for justice to prosper.</p>\n","title":"The Re-Education of (the) US"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Jenna Arnold is an American businessperson and serial entrepreneur who has her finger on the pulse of the American identity.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>She is known as the co-founder of ORGANIZE, for her work at the United Nations and MTV, and most recently as a National Organizer for the Women's March on Washington.</li>\n\t<li>Jenna&nbsp;is the Chief Impact Officer at an impact venture fund, Rethink Capital Partners, helping shape the fund's plan for meaningful and measurable impact across education, community, food, and women-led companies.</li>\n\t<li>ORGANIZE launched the country’s first central organ donor registry, was awarded an Innovator in Residence position in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</li>\n\t<li>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>called ORGANIZE one of the “Biggest Ideas in Social Change,” and the organization has been featured by FastCompany, ESPN,&nbsp;<em>Slate</em>,&nbsp;<em>SELF</em>, and UpWorthy, and regularly quoted in outlets such as the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post&nbsp;</em>and the Associated Press<em>.</em></li>\n\t<li>Arnold&nbsp;published&nbsp;a groundbreaking book,&nbsp;<em>Raising Our Hands,</em>&nbsp;on the research she has been conducting around the state of the American woman, asking&nbsp;white women to have a radical and honest conversation with themselves about race, identity, privilege, and power — and how they can use their influence to take an active role in creating a better future.</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Jenna&nbsp;Arnold has her finger on the pulse of the American identity and is not shy to tell you where and how we can snap out of our current apathy toward the headlines and find our way back to each other.
