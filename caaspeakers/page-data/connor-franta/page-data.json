He has taken his brand beyond the realms of social media by penning the <i>New York Times’</i> best-selling memoir&nbsp;<i>A Work in Progress</i>, curating the Billboard-charting Common Culture Music Series compilation albums, and co-founding Heard Well, the first record label powered by social tastemakers. Earlier this year, he launched a specialty coffee line, Common Culture Coffee, a specialty coffee line that is part of his&nbsp;Common Culture&nbsp;brand which offers superior clothing, premium coffee, and a variety of undiscovered musical talent. Last year, he announced a partnership with Urban Outfitters to distribute exclusive pieces from his clothing collection with all proceeds going to GLSEN.</p>\n\n<p>Connor partnered with Supergravity Pictures via Heard Well to release&nbsp;<i>GAYBY BABY</i>, which was the #1 film in the iTunes documentary section and which he also helped curate the music for.&nbsp; The film won&nbsp;best documentary&nbsp;at the Australian Film Critics Association Awards, scored first runner-up for&nbsp;best documentary&nbsp;at the Sydney Film Festival, and was nominated for an AACTA Award for best feature-length documentary&nbsp;by the Australian Film Institute.</p>\n\n<p>He is the winner of the&nbsp;People's Choice Award&nbsp;for&nbsp;Favorite YouTube Star, Logo’s&nbsp;Social Trailblazer Award, as well as the Thirst Project’s&nbsp;Governor's Award&nbsp;for raising over $400,000 for The Thirst Project to provide clean, safe drinking water to people in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Connor was honored by GLSEN for his deep commitment to LGBTQ youth. Through his online presence that touches millions of youth, he has elevated GLSEN programs, such as GLSEN’s Day of Silence, and most recently, all proceeds from his collaboration with Urban Outfitters went directly to GLSEN.</p>\n\n<p>He released his second book, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Note to Self </i>which is full of&nbsp;intimate, raw, honest, and inspiring reflections on his own life as he's living it right now, as well as his observations about contemporary culture.&nbsp;</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>YouTube Star &amp; Entrepreneur</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Michelle Phan","partyId":"BA12463A-F70E-4D30-A3A7-314AAB531645","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Make-Up Artist &amp; Blogger</p>\n","friendlyId":"michelle-phan"},{"name":"Jenna Marbles","partyId":"EE826D1A-FB33-45E7-8048-0F3B52631BDE","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Social Media Personality &amp; Blogger</p>\n","friendlyId":"jenna-marbles"},{"name":"Bethany Mota","partyId":"2D7083AB-223B-4586-BDE6-3EE03F39EF83","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>YouTube Star</p>\n","friendlyId":"bethany-mota"},{"name":"Matt Bellassai","partyId":"E68BDC36-79E4-4970-9340-859D0D2070D6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Former Writer, Producer &amp; Star, BuzzFeed's \"Whine About It\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"matt-bellassai"},{"name":"Zach King","partyId":"C1416212-568D-4329-B80C-3A28EF9649F9","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Filmmaker, Content Creator &amp; Social Media Sensation</p>","friendlyId":"zach-king"}],"topics":["Creativity","LGBTQIA+ Advocacy","Mental Health","Social Justice"],"types":["Bestselling Authors","Celebrity Entrepreneurs","Digital Influencers","Entrepreneurs","Founders / CEOs"]}}},
