She believes that the current $2.5 trillion in combined Black and Latino purchasing power is creating the next big emerging market ‒ right here in the United States. She invests in startups led by Black and Latino founders and the companies that serve those markets.</p>\n\n<p>Monique is also the Founder and Executive Director of Black Founders a nonprofit startup started by four tech friends in a San Francisco restaurant over shrimp and grits and jazz music. Their hack-a-thons at historically Black colleges and universities and workshops and conferences for founders are designed to move entrepreneurs from idea to execution. With a mission to increase the number of successful Black entrepreneurs in tech, the organization has cultivated a new generation of tech founders from Silicon Valley to New York City, Atlanta, Austin, and several HBCU campuses.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Monique served as one of the first Innovation Fellows for the San Francisco Mayor’s Office where she worked on the many ways that a city at the epicenter of innovation can use technology to transform workforce and other government services.
