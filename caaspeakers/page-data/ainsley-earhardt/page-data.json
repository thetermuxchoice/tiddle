Each morning, next to her cereal bowl, her father left words of wisdom: a scripture, an indelible quote or some sort of valuable information. One of her favorites was a quote from Walt Disney, \"I hope I'll never be afraid to fail.\" These \"sayings\" inspired Earhardt to follow her dreams and accept new challenges. She found it easier and easier to say \"yes\" to new opportunities and along the way.... her father's voice was her guide. Earhardt will tell you about her journey, what it's like to work at FOX News Channel and the people who have made a big impression on her career.</p>\n","title":"Lessons Learned While Eating Cereal"},{"text":"<p>As a journalist, Earhardt sees the news first. She gets to choose which stories to pass along to the viewer, she takes that responsibility seriously and considers her job an honor. In the course of her career, she has told countless stories of heroes coming home from war, children fighting the odds and surviving cancer or (a favorite of hers) the child who is bullied and learns to forgive his classmates after getting recognition from an NFL team. Sharing these stories gives the viewer a glimpse of goodness and reminds them of the gift of humanity. She will share some of the news with you and how impressed she is with the outpouring of support from viewers when someone is in need.</p>\n","title":"The Power of Press: Making a Daily Difference"}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ainsley Earhardt is the co-host of FOX News Channel's (FNC)&nbsp;<em><span>FOX &amp; Friends.</span></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Currently on track to have its highest-rated year in history,<em>&nbsp;FOX &amp; Friends</em>&nbsp;provides viewers with the latest on the daily headlines across news, sports, politics and entertainment.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>As co-host, Earhardt recently sat-down for exclusive interviews with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to her role on <em>FOX &amp; Friends</em>, Earhardt appears across FNC's on demand subscription-based streaming service FOX Nation as co-host of <em>FOX &amp; Friends’ After the Show Show.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Earhardt previously served as co-host of FNC's early morning wake up program,&nbsp;<em>FOX &amp; Friends FIRST.&nbsp;</em>Prior to joining<em>&nbsp;FOX &amp; Friends First</em>, she worked as a reporter for FNC where she covered many high-profile news stories, including the arrest of kidnapper Ariel Castro in Cleveland, OH, the fatal 2013 EF5 tornado in Moore, OK, and the 8.0-magnitude earthquake in China.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ainsley Earhardt is the co-host of FOX News Channel's (FNC)&nbsp;<em><span>FOX &amp; Friends&nbsp;</span></em>(weekdays 6-9AM/ET) alongside Steve Doocy &amp; Brian Kilmeade.
