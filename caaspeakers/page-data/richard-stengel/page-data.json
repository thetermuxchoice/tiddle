Describing his role at the State Department as &ldquo;Chief Marketing Officer of Brand USA,&rdquo; Stengel remains centered at the crossroads of media, policy, and politics &ndash; and speaks widely on fake news and disinformation, the case for national service, diplomacy, and leadership lessons from reporting on the world&rsquo;s great leaders. As Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs (2013-16), Stengel brought public diplomacy into the 21st century, modernizing communications, expanding the department&rsquo;s digital footprint, and ensuring that every ambassador was on social media.
