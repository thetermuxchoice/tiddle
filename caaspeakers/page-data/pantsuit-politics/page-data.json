People sitting together in pews every Sunday feel like strangers and loved ones at the dinner table feel like enemies. Toxic political dialogue, hate-filled rants on social media, and agenda-driven news stories have become the new norm. But it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</p>\n\n<p>In this conversation, Sarah Stewart Holland and Beth Silvers, co-hosts of Pantsuit Politics from opposite ends of the political spectrum, teach us that politics don&#39;t have to divide us and that people from opposing political perspectives truly can have calm, grace-&shy;filled conversations with one another. Instead, we can bring the same care and respect to policy discussions that we bring to the rest of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Audiences will walk away with&nbsp;all of the tools&nbsp;needed to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Respect the dignity of every person</li>\n\t<li>Recognize that issues are nuanced and can&#39;t be reduced to political talking points</li>\n\t<li>Listen in order to understand</li>\n\t<li>Lead with grace and patience</li>\n</ul>","title":"I Think You’re Wrong (But I’m Listening): A Guide to Grace-Filled Political Conversation","sortOrder":0},{"text":"<p>From friendships to Facebook to far-off countries, what do we do when our lives seem mired in conflict?

In this conversation, they will help you understand the powerful connections you have with other people on a personal, community-based, national, and even international level. Sarah and Beth will open the door to a future that is characterized by hope, love, and connection despite our differences.</p>\n\n<p>Audiences will walk away with a better understanding of how to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Engage your family with a spirit of curiosity</li>\n\t<li>Listen closely to the anxieties and fears of your friends</li>\n\t<li>Explore shared values within your community</li>\n\t<li>Understand your work as a citizen in a diverse country</li>\n\t<li>Hold lightly those things that are beyond your control around the world</li>\n</ul>","title":"Now What?
