Crew catalog. While there, she was contacted by television producers who wanted to adapt a story about interracial dating that she'd written for <em>GQ</em> into a series; the project never materialized, but it sparked Kemp's interest in writing for television.</p>\n\n<p>At the age of 26, she relocated to Los Angeles and landed work as a staff writer on <em>The Bernie Mac Show</em> (Fox, 2001-06). The experience led to other writing and story editing assignments on series like <em>Eli Stone</em> (ABC, 2008-09) before Kemp hit her stride as a writer and producer on <em>The Good Wife</em>. She shared a Emmy nomination for Outstanding Drama Series in 2011 with producers Ridley and Tony Scott before departing the CBS series the following year; Kemp then served as producer and occasional writer on network programs like <em>Hawaii 5-0</em> (CBS, 2010- ) before moving up to showrunner with <em>Power</em>. The crime series, co-produced and co-starring rapper Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, was one of the most successful series in the Starz stable, garnering the highest audience numbers for its second season premiere and finale in the network's history.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Showrunner, Starz Network's <i>Power</i></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Kerry Washington","partyId":"0E2CABBF-B66E-47CA-B84F-57287A86FB64","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress &amp; Activist</p>\n","friendlyId":"kerry-washington"},{"name":"Viola Davis","partyId":"2170B98E-36B5-428B-BB56-37749EC5972B","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress &amp; Bestselling Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"viola-davis"},{"name":"Cedric \"The Entertainer\"","partyId":"D1FEA3C9-1D2A-4D49-A6A1-ADE37C964B83","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Star, TV Land's \"The Soul Man\"</p>\n","friendlyId":"cedric-entertainer"},{"name":"Ava DuVernay","partyId":"C010E083-B04B-40DF-A1BF-0E05D00077E6","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Director</p>\n","friendlyId":"ava-duvernay"},{"name":"Jesse Williams","partyId":"D3DA973F-7044-4006-8239-EE11F6B880C9","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Star, ABC&#39;s <em>Grey&#39;s Anatomy</em></p>","friendlyId":"jesse-williams"},{"name":"Billy Porter","partyId":"B370A28B-474B-4FAD-9092-B792FF7F6398","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Tony, Grammy &amp; Emmy-Award Winning Actor</p>\n","friendlyId":"billy-porter"}],"topics":["Black History & Culture","Storytelling"],"types":["College & University","Writers / Creators"]}}},
