She can currently be seen as Maribel in a recurring role on the Showtime series, <em>The L Word: Generation Q</em>, opposite Jennifer Beals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Growing up, Mercado developed a love for fashion, but the industry&rsquo;s Eurocentric and ableist beauty standards meant that she didn&rsquo;t see herself represented. A native New Yorker born to Dominican parents and diagnosed with muscular dystrophy in her early teens, she resolved to redress this inequality by entering the fashion industry herself. She studied a degree in marketing at FIT, going on to intern at Allure magazine in a bid to &ldquo;learn the politics behind fashion so I could hire people who looked like me,&rdquo; she said at Women of the World&rsquo;s 10th annual summit.</p>\n\n<p>Mercado uses her platform to push for greater representation in the industry, saying in an interview with Bustle &ldquo;I just hope that [underrepresented people] see themselves in me, in any way possible.&rdquo; Her activism, which focuses on the intersection of gender and disability, has included working with UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres&nbsp;to reduce inequality, one of the UN&rsquo;s 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</p>","title":""}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Actress, Model&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Activist</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Cleo Wade","partyId":"02AB3D42-813B-4227-9AFF-A7E764146B1F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Poet &amp; Bestselling Author</p>\n","friendlyId":"cleo-wade"},{"name":"Ally Love","partyId":"A8FF59AF-82D8-419B-9A9C-3701F8B5035A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p><span><span><span><span><span>Founder &amp; CEO of Love Squad; Peloton Instructor; In-Arena Host of the Brooklyn Nets</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n","friendlyId":"ally-love"},{"name":"Zendaya","partyId":"A9A27226-D7A3-425B-B2C1-16C7449BBA6C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Actress, HBO’s <em>Euphoria</em>;&nbsp;Musician &amp;&nbsp;Model</p>\n","friendlyId":"zendaya"},{"name":"Winnie Harlow","partyId":"5AC66367-DD67-40AB-811B-631E23AA288C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Supermodel and Advocate&nbsp;</p>\n","friendlyId":"winnie-harlow"},{"name":"Steven Canals","partyId":"F442D992-9DE4-4807-AAF1-DABDA4423E21","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Creator, FX's <em>POSE</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"steven-canals"},{"name":"Selma Blair","partyId":"03F4A727-66AD-40DC-AFD7-0CFC400D8FB0","speakerNameSubheading":"<p><span><span><span><span><span>Actress, Bestselling Author, and Disability Rights Advocate</span></span></span></span></span></p>","friendlyId":"selma-blair"}],"topics":["Disability","Diversity⸒ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Fashion","Inspirational Stories","LGBTQIA+ Advocacy","Latinx & Hispanic Culture","Women's Empowerment"],"types":["Actresses","College & University","Inspiring Women"]}}},
