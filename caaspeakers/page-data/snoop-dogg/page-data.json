Being the trendsetter he is, Snoop stands at the forefront of popular culture with award-winning and multi-platinum albums and songs, critically acclaimed films and television shows, lifestyle products, philanthropic efforts and digital ventures, including his YouTube original series “GGN News.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Best known as an MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of Dr. Dre’s most notable protégés, he collaborated on several tracks on Dr. Dre’s solo debut, The Chronic and on the titular theme song to the film Deep Cover. Snoop’s debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records. Doggystyle went quadruple platinum and spawned several hit singles, including Who Am I (What’s My Name)” and “Gin &amp; Juice”. His second album, Tha Doggfather, was his last release for Death Row. Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, which released his album “Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss”, and then he signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums. When Snoop Dogg isn’t rapping, he is Snoop Lion. When he isn’t playing reggae music, he is DJing as Dj Snoopadelic. Still with the same stoner, chill, musically inclined attitude, Snoop brings his talents to the turntables and gets the crowds dancing and moving to the beats. He is proving that he really can do everything from acting, to rapping, to playing reggae music to being a disc jockey.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Quadruple Platinum Rapper, Actor, and DJ</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Sean \"Diddy\" Combs","partyId":"ED36F12C-AB5D-4D88-A6EC-B25699C4193F","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>CEO &amp; Founder, Bad Boy Worldwide Entertainment Group</p>\n","friendlyId":"sean-diddy-combs"},{"name":"Lenny Kravitz","partyId":"8767B0FA-8328-4843-9898-FD61B4694F67","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Grammy Award-Winning Musician &amp; Actor</p>\n","friendlyId":"lenny-kravitz"},{"name":"Will.i.am","partyId":"7CFE9FF6-91CF-4625-BA91-F8EFBE838619","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Musician</p>\n","friendlyId":"william"},{"name":"Saweetie","partyId":"0A86B000-BB54-4F05-980F-0FFFFD6CF50A","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Rapper, Songwriter, Actress and Designer</p>\n","friendlyId":"saweetie"},{"name":"Martha Stewart","partyId":"4EA791F0-7D61-4070-A28A-A12C02206C9C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Emmy Award-Winning TV Host; Founder, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia</p>","friendlyId":"martha-stewart"},{"name":"Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges","partyId":"4A3878A5-C010-40FB-9352-5BC459F19F84","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Multi-Grammy Award Winning Hip-Hop Artist</p>\n","friendlyId":"chris-ludacris-bridges"}],"topics":["Metaverse & Web3","Cryptocurrency & Blockchain","Humor","Black History & Culture","Pop Culture"],"types":["Celebrity Entrepreneurs","Celebrity Speakers","Musicians"]}}},
