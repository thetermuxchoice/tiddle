She is the founder and CEO of Dustlight Productions, and Ad Week’s 2019 “Producer of the Year.” She most recently hosted and executive produced the podcast, <em>Hello, Nature</em> by REI Co-Op Studios &amp; Dustlight, presented by Subaru. The show tells the history and present-day story of the American National Parks through BIPOC voices, asking the question, “Since the parks are public, are they truly for everyone?” She’s also the creator and host of <em>Tell Them, I Am</em>, presented by Higher Ground Audio and Spotify and produced by Dustlight. In Ramadan 2021, she hosted and executive produced season two of the podcast, which premiered exclusively in Rolling Stone.</p>\n\n<p>In its debut year, the LA Times called <em>Tell Them, I Am</em> “quietly revolutionary.” The New York Times called it “hypnotic listening” and TIME, The Atlantic, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, Huffington Post, and the NYT Podcast Club named it one of their best podcasts of 2019. The series is about the small defining moments in our lives— the voices are all Muslim; the stories are universal.</p>\n\n<p>Misha is an Executive Producer on <em>Renegades: Born in the USA and The Michelle Obama Podcast</em>, produced by Dustlight, in collaboration with Higher Ground Audio and Spotify. In 2019, she produced <em>The Big One: Your Survival Guide</em>, named one of TIME, The Atlantic, Thrillist, Vulture, IndieWire, and NYT Podcast Club’s best podcasts of the year. The New Yorker’s Sarah Larson called it “riveting” and “strangely reassuring.” All this podcasting started in 2017, with Misha’s autobiographical series, <em>Beginner</em>, about learning to belong as an immigrant in America.</p>\n\n<p>When Misha wants to take a break from podcasting, she hosts Quran Book Club on IGTV, makes jokes on McSweeney’s, writes serious things for the Wall Street Journal, and speaks about storytelling, identity, ethical entrepreneurship. Sometimes, she naps. But that’s not featured anywhere. She got her Master’s in Journalism at Northwestern University, has taught as an adjunct professor at USC Annenberg and the Transom Radio Workshop, and is the author of the online guide, <em>How To Make a Podcast</em>.</p>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Podcast Host and Producer</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[],"relatedSpeakers":[{"name":"Dan Pfeiffer","partyId":"6AE1E726-6BB4-483B-ACE3-CAE469F5BB67","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Host of&nbsp;<em>Pod Save America</em>&nbsp;&amp; Former Senior Advisor, Obama Administration</p>","friendlyId":"dan-pfeiffer"},{"name":"Audie Cornish","partyId":"9B833D73-AC97-47CB-A803-44FEF39A4B33","speakerNameSubheading":"<p data-hook=\"text\">CNN Correspondent &amp; Host, <em>The Assignment</em> Podcast</p>","friendlyId":"audie-cornish"},{"name":"Ari Shapiro","partyId":"7CA11B88-23F8-4389-9BF9-947537E2C695","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Co-Host, NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"ari-shapiro"},{"name":"Roger Bennett","partyId":"791BA163-7EF5-419E-89DB-737E87D155B8","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>#1 New York Times Bestselling Author, <em>(Re)Born in the USA</em>; Co-Host of NBC's&nbsp;<em>Men in Blazers</em></p>\n","friendlyId":"roger-bennett"},{"name":"Dan Pashman","partyId":"B6AE7F52-BA83-4CC4-943D-D258F70A571C","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Award-Winning Host &amp; Creator of&nbsp;<em>The Sporkful</em>&nbsp;Podcast</p>\n","friendlyId":"dan-pashman"},{"name":"Maya Shankar","partyId":"DF1BCA37-6F29-405A-8A1B-4F104581CD30","speakerNameSubheading":"<p>Global Director of Behavioral Economics, Google</p>\n","friendlyId":"maya-shankar"}],"topics":["Climate Change & Sustainability","Creativity","Diversity⸒ Equity & Inclusion (DEI)","Storytelling"],"types":["College & University","Inspiring Women","Moderator Hosts & Emcees","Podcast Hosts","Writers / Creators"]}}},
