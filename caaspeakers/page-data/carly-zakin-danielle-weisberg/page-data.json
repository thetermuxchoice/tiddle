That’s why now is the time for women to find allies and advocate for themselves with their money, in their careers and at home. theSkimm’s Danielle Weisberg and Carly Zakin share tips on how working women can build financial confidence, combat setbacks, and own their careers.</p>\n","title":"Helping Women Navigate the \"She-cession\""},{"text":"<p>After a period of drastic global change and uncertainty, the professional and personal needs of employees have changed. theSkimm&rsquo;s Danielle Weisberg and Carly Zakin provide a framework that reimagines the future of the workplace, offering solutions that support the needs of all.
