He launched his Spotlight On initiative in 2016 after the loss of his cousin to gun violence in Chicago. The initiative aims to give youth hope for a better future by shining a spotlight on youth in the community who are actively changing the city for the better and are leading and empowering others to make change happen. He continued his activism against gun violence by supporting the Parkland students in their efforts through March for Our Lives and launching a Parkland 17 art exhibit at Florida Art Walk to honor the seventeen lives lost and to bring awareness to the need for stronger gun control laws.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In June 2013, Dwyane received a Humanitarian Award at the BET Awards for his commitment to excellence and dedication to community and worldly charitable causes.
