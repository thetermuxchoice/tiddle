After surviving the bloodiest clash of the war in Afghanistan, he left the military and walked on the Clemson football in order to fulfill a promise to a friend who died on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>Rodriguez’s father passed away four days after his high school graduation. He sought out the military and spent 15 months in Iraq before heading to Afghanistan, where he found himself in the bloodiest battle of the war. As more than 300 Tailban assaulted his combat outpost, it was partially overrun and nearly destroyed. During the 18-hour point-blank battle, eight U.S. soldiers were killed, including Rodriguez’s close friend, Pfc. Kevin Thompson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The two had bonded over making plans for what they would do after they got out of the military. Six months later, Rodriguez returned home only to battle the psychological effects of war. After earning a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his bravery, suicidal thoughts and heavy drinking became the new normal. Spurred by the desire to make his friend’s death meaningful, Rodriguez decided to make a change. He enrolled in community college, raised his grades, and vowed to make good on the promise he had made to Thompson – to get his education and play college football.</p>\n\n<p>While at Clemson, Rodriguez was honored with the Discover Orange Bowl Courage Award for his display of courage on and off the field. He also received the Armed Forces Merit Award, presented by the Football Writers Association of America and honoring an individual with a military background that has made an impact in college football. During his senior season with the Tigers, he published&nbsp;his autobiography&nbsp;<em>Rise: A Soldier, A Dream and a Promise Kept,</em>&nbsp;the firsthand account of his journey from Kamdesh to Clemson. He was awarded the American Hero Award by the Walter Camp Foundation and was the Veteran Leadership Honoree at the 9th Annual Heroes Gala presented by the IAVA (Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America). Rodriguez graduated with honors from Clemson and briefly signed with the now LA Rams&nbsp;of the NFL.</p>\n\n<p>Never asking for a handout, only a chance, he reminds audiences what it means to take control and work to succeed with determination. Rodriguez shares the story of how he came back from the edge of war to honor his friend’s life and create a new one for himself. His accomplishments resonate with anyone who has ever fought for what they wanted.</p>\n\n<p>Rodriguez portrayed himself in Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Outpost</em>, the #1 streamed movie of 2020, and just completed filming another movie in Thailand with John David Washington. He also started creating music, fulfilling a longtime goal of becoming a music artist. Rodriguez currently resides in Los Angeles, California.</p>\n</section>\n"}],"speakerBioQuote":[],"speakerNameSubheading":[{"text":"<p>Purple Heart Recipient &amp; NFL Recruit</p>\n"}],"speakerNewAndNoteworthy":[],"speakerReview":[{"text":"<p>Daniel’s visit had a big impact on the cadets who met with him and heard him speak.

Over 800 people gathered to hear his story of coming of age through the shock of warfare, substance abuse, loss, perseverance and redemption. He is an amazing young man with a powerful, well-delivered message.<br />\n<br />\nAs his story unfolded he established an immediate connection with the audience and something deeper with the dozens of individuals that waited after his talk to meet him, shake his hand, share a hug or exchange tear-filled whispered words. Daniel made time for them all. It was impossible to tell who got more out of the experience – Daniel or those that he took the time to speak with.<br />\n<br />\nOur attendees responded to him in a way that exceeded all expectations.</p>\n","title":"SPEAKER REVIEW","reviewer":{"name":"Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association "}},{"text":"<p>Daniel was absolutely wonderful.
