Arne shares how to fix America’s schools with an incredible firsthand look at successful, creative approaches, focus on the right data and strong advocacy for early childhood education. He believes that education should be the ultimate equalizer. No matter race, class or zip code, access to a great education is a national-security issue and an economic issue: the best-educated workforce keeps jobs in the U.S. and breaks cycles of poverty.</p>\n","title":"How Schools Work: An Inside Account of Failure and Success From One of the Nation’s Longest-Serving Secretaries of Education"},{"text":"<p>As Managing Partner of Emerson Collective, an organization dedicated to removing barriers to opportunity so people can live to their full potential, Arne Duncan leads Chicago CRED (Creating Real Economic Destiny). CRED aims to reduce the number of shootings and gun violence in Chicago. While many see dismal criminal and gun violence statistics, Arne is up close and personal with citizens living in the most violent, hopeless areas of the city. At CRED, he works with young adults and formerly incarcerated citizens to provide mentors, job opportunities, health services that can turn around individuals one-by-one, thus transforming a city. Above all, Arne speaks with incredible hope and optimism about the hard work, character and strength of the youth he encounters daily.
