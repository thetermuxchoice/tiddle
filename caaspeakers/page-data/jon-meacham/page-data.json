Through Lincoln&rsquo;s story, Jon illustrates the ways and means of politics in a democracy, the roots and durability of racism, and the capacity of conscience to shape events.</p>","title":"Lincoln In Our Time:  What the Life of Abraham Lincoln Can Teach Us About Leadership, Citizenship, and How We Can Overcome Division","sortOrder":0},{"text":"<p>As difficult as the present is, the American past is the story of challenges overcome, crises resolved, and progress made. In this nonpartisan speech, Jon Meacham walks audiences through moments that have seemed intractable &ndash; which can include the Influenza Pandemic of 1918, the battle against polio, FDR&rsquo;s reaction to the first days of the Depression, Winston Churchill&rsquo;s decision to fight on against Hitler, and the Cuban Missile Crisis &ndash; to offer lessons for leaders in how to endure and prevail when everything appears hopeless.</p>","title":"Hope Through History: How To Endure and Prevail When Everything Appears Hopeless","sortOrder":1},{"text":"<p>This is an illuminating and entertaining presentation of music and history, presented by the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Jon Meacham.&nbsp;With a multimedia presentation of images and iconic selections from great American songs, Meacham offers a glimpse of the American past and a message for the present: that America has always been defined by strife and discord, yet has managed to move forward.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Battle-Hymn of the Republic&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;I Wish I Was in Dixie&rsquo;s Land&rdquo;; &ldquo;Happy Days Are Here Again&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Ballad of the Green Berets&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Blowin in the Wind&rdquo;; &ldquo;Born in the U.S.A.&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;God Bless the USA&rdquo;&mdash;the whole panoply of America can be traced&mdash;and more importantly, <em>heard </em>and <em>felt</em>&mdash;in the songs&nbsp;that echo through our public squares. This is engaging history that speaks to the moment&nbsp;and beyond.</p>","title":"Songs of America: History, Music, and the Story of a Nation","sortOrder":2},{"text":"<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham explores what 21st-century leaders in different fields of endeavor can learn from the greatest moments of our common past.</p>\n\n<p>This non-partisan presentation features lessons ranging from Jefferson&#39;s pragmatism and JFK&#39;s capacity to recover from his own mistakes to the management of conflicting egos as shown by Reagan and FDR and how George HW Bush dealt with the end of his Presidency. Meacham discusses how history can inform the decisions all of us make every day in positions that demand creative and innovative solutions.</p>","title":"The Art of Leadership: Lessons From the American Presidency","sortOrder":3},{"text":"<p>In this contentious moment of debate about Confederate memorials and the place of history in an increasingly diverse nation, Jon Meacham describes &ndash; in reasonable,&nbsp;non-partisan, non-ideological terms &ndash; the long story of race in America and offers audiences new ways to assess what role emblems of the past should play in an increasingly diverse 21st century.</p>","title":"The Future of the Past: How To Think About Race and Memory in the 21st Century","sortOrder":4},{"text":"<p>For some people, the key to understanding the media is ideology&ndash;that outlets are driven by politics rather than objectivity. There is much truth to this, and the 21st century is now more like the 18th and 19th in terms of partisan news. But there&rsquo;s an even more fundamental point Americans should grasp: that many journalists are driven as much by conflict as by creeds. Jon Meacham brings renewed perspective to the issue of media bias, grounded in historical analysis and his own life&rsquo;s work with print and television news media outlets. Meacham cuts to the core of media bias, explaining how politics and human nature shape the news you see and read.</p>","title":"The Media’s Secret Bias: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Truth About the News","sortOrder":5},{"text":"<p>In this nonpartisan, anecdotally rich presentation, Meacham describes previous moments of crisis and partisan deadlock in American history and suggests how previous generations &mdash; and we, in our own time &mdash; transcended hours of fear by heeding what Lincoln called &ldquo;the better angels of our nature.&rdquo; Examples range from Reconstruction and President Grant to woman&rsquo;s suffrage and President Wilson to the crisis of the 1930s and FDR and the passage of civil rights legislation under LBJ.</p>","title":"The Soul of America","sortOrder":6}],"speakerBioSummary":[{"text":"<ul>\n\t<li>Presidential historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham is one of America&#39;s most prominent public intellectuals.</li>\n\t<li>A skilled orator with a depth of knowledge about politics, religion, and current affairs, Meacham has the unique ability to bring history to life and offer historical context to current events and issues impacting our daily lives.</li>\n\t<li>A contributor to&nbsp;<i>TIME</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>, Meacham is a highly sought-after commentator, regularly appearing on MSNBC, CNN, and other news outlets.</li>\n\t<li>Meacham is the author of multiple&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers including,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icmspeakers.com/speaker/jon-meacham/#work_0_2041\"><i>Songs of America</i></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icmspeakers.com/speaker/jon-meacham/#work_0_2041\"><i>The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels</i></a>, and his latest, <em>And There Was Light.</em></li>\n\t<li>Named a &ldquo;Global Leader for Tomorrow&rdquo; by the World Economic Forum, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow of the Society of American Historians.</li>\n\t<li>Meacham is a frequent guest on&nbsp;<i>Morning Joe</i>;&nbsp;<i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i>;&nbsp;<i>The 11th Hour</i>, and was featured in Ken Burns&rsquo; documentary series&nbsp;<i>The Roosevelts: An Intimate History</i>.</li>\n\t<li>His latest book,&nbsp;<em>And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle</em>, will be published in the fall of 2022.</li>\n</ul>","title":""}],"speakerBioBriefHeader":[],"speakerBiography":[{"text":"<p>Presidential historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham is one of America&#39;s most prominent public intellectuals.
